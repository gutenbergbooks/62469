<p>The English language, flexible and rich though it be,
lacks words in which to convey the subtler social distinctions.
We have had to go abroad for ‘nouveau-riche’
and ‘parvenu,’ to say nothing of ‘Philistia,’
‘Bohemia,’ the ‘demi-monde,’ and all the other geographical
names that we have taken from the atlas of
the human world to describe some small corner in our
own little parish. But, as our civilization grows more
and more complex, so does our borrowed vocabulary
grow less and less adequate, until nowadays we find
not a few fine differences in our microcosm which no
word of our own or of any other nation avails to
identify. The ‘Arrived’ and the ‘New-rich’ are
familiar figures, but what of those many families who
suddenly become wealthy and prominent after many
generations of well-bred obscurity? They cannot
fairly be described as ‘nouveau-riche’ or ‘parvenu’;
they have been there all the time, though not in
evidence; to brand them with the stigma of novelty
would be manifestly unfair. They have antiquity
without importance&mdash;a vast difference, in the eyes
of social astronomers, between them and the blazing
stars of wealth that so suddenly emerge from the black<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
night of genealogical non-existence. As well compare
a dazzling meteor, here and gone in a flash, with
a genuine star which, after æons of inconspicuousness,
abruptly swells into a luminary of the first magnitude.
To describe such fixed lights in our English hemisphere
a new word must first be coined in another language,
and then borrowed. Such people are not ‘nouveau-riche’;
they are ‘renrichis.’ And to this class belonged
the Dadds of Darnley-on-Downe&mdash;that obscure
dynasty from which it is now necessary to show the
gradual genesis, through many quiet generations, of
Kingston Darnley, its apostate offspring.</p>

<p>Among soft Kentish meadows sleeps the little
metropolis of Darnley-on-Downe. It lies on the grassy
plain like a neat poached egg on a vast green plate, and,
over all, the blue vault of heaven makes a domed lid.
The Downe meanders placidly at the foot of its gardens,
and comfortable little Georgian houses speak of
agelong ease and decent leisure. Darnley-on-Downe
has no local peer, no local palace; rank and fashion,
therefore, are represented only by these dignified
dwellings of red brick, each enclosed in shrubberies of
rose and laurel and lilac, each tenanted by some
family well known for generations in Darnley-on-Downe.</p>

<p>As Cranford was, as Highbury was, so also was
Darnley-on-Downe&mdash;placid, happy and exclusive, intolerant
of all new-comers and of all change. Mrs.
John succeeded Mrs. Joshua, and Mr. Reuben Mr.
James; and no outsider was ever permitted to disturb
the orderly dynasties that so long had ruled in the
little town. Crowns fell, but the serenity of Darnley-on-Downe
remained unruffled, and the collapse of the
Corsican ogre took no higher rank in general conversation
than the misdoings of Mrs. Blessing’s Matilda, or
the strange theft of Miss Minna Dadd’s Leghorns. So,<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
talking only to themselves, and only of themselves, the
aristocracy of Darnley-on-Downe passed inconspicuously
from the nursery to the grave, through the
leisurely old days when the peace of the country contrasted
so strongly with the restless misery of the great
cities, and, in the absence of halfpenny morning
papers, only rare rumours filtered down into the provinces
of a young Queen gradually making her seat
secure on a dishonoured and endangered throne.</p>

<p>Nowadays Cranford, probably, plays pit, and
motors hoot beneath the walls of Donwell Abbey.
Nowadays clash and clangour fill the one main street
of Darnley-on-Downe, and the Georgian houses are
being swept away to make room for glassy palaces of
art-nouveau design. But, in the days when Fortune
swooped so suddenly on the Dadds, only peace and
slumber haunted the Market Place and St. Eldred’s.</p>

<p>Clean, humble, small, and quiet, the cottages and
shops of the working-classes lined the broad pavement,
with here a neat bank fronted by Corinthian pilasters,
and there a rambling, wide-mouthed inn, haunted by
loafing dogs and ostlers full of leisure. Then came the
church, solid and unassuming, very essence made
visible of that orderly if unimpassioned spirit that then
possessed the Church of England. Under its shadow,
flanked by tall clipped obelisks of yew, squatted the
solid square of the vicarage, with green lawn and beds
of roses leading down to the wicket that opened on the
roadway. And beyond this again began a wide,
ancient avenue of limes, fragrant and tranquil, on
whose either side stretched that series of red-brick
houses in which the Upper Ten of Darnley-on-Downe
discreetly led its days, and formed an aristocracy no
less rigid, no less zealous for birth and tradition
than that higher world called ‘county,’ with which
it had nothing to do, and yet so much in common.<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
St. Eldred’s was the name of this provincial faubourg,
and the wayfarer, passing down its green length, might
divine its exclusive character from the lack of any
invidious distinction made between the houses. The
identity of each was kept sacred for the elect, and the
outsider was to know nothing. In our own assertive
time each gate would bear a curly Gothic title&mdash;‘Chatsworth,’
‘Arundel,’ ‘Sandringham’ would gratify
our loyal eyes. In those days Mrs. Blessing knew Miss
Dadd’s house, and Miss Dadd knew Mrs. Blessing’s.
This knowledge was held to be amply sufficient, and
it was even felt that to share it with the unprivileged
world at large would be profane and vulgar. Thus
the unguided stranger would have travelled uninstructed
past gateway after gateway, past trim
red wall after trim red wall, without being able to
attribute any definite personality to the dweller in
each cloistered precinct. And therefore he must
necessarily have passed on his way without gathering
any idea of the extent to which the Dadds dominated
St. Eldred’s.</p>

<p>All the dwellers in these houses lived in a small way,
and all of them drew their incomes from some retail
trade. ‘County’ people, from their own high circle,
contemplating these lesser worlds, would never have
guessed the intense and silent arrogance with which,
in turn, these lesser worlds looked down on the
struggling aspirants from beneath, on the new and
unknown persons who painfully fought to win a footing
in St. Eldred’s. But, in the close ring of this
aristocracy, the Dadds were certainly the ruling
dynasty. Had the wayfarer been privileged with a
guide, he would have learned that every fourth house
in St. Eldred’s enshrined a Dadd or the relation of
a Dadd. Here dwelt Mrs. Reuben Dadd; yonder
Mr. and Mrs. Joshua Dadd; and, not a stone’s-throw<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
farther, was the house of the Misses Adelaide and
Minna Dadd. As for the head of the family, Mr.
Dadd, with his consort, dwelt in a stout-pillared
edifice which even an uninstructed stranger must have
seen to be the residence of a presiding Power.</p>

<p>The Dadds permeated social life in Darnley-on-Downe.
They were everywhere, had married into
every family, had accorded brides to every neighbouring
house of repute, had come at last to be, as it
were, the very incarnation of decency and proper pride
in Darnley-on-Downe. They were no richer than
their neighbours, but in those days wealth gave no
precedence, and the Dadds had a prestige which their
fellow-nobles in St. Eldred’s lacked. For the Dadds
owned land, and, though St. Eldred’s made no attempt
to connect itself with the world of landowners and
county families, yet a vague aroma of grandeur still
clung to the one family in its midst that might be said
to verge on the territorial class. The glory of the
Dadds was a big freehold farm beyond the town, where
they had been established from time immemorial,
honourably obscure from the days of Henry the
Eighth. St. Eldred’s, accordingly, cherishing its own
pedigrees and antiquities, as it did, with as fervent a
passion as any Austrian noble, yet by tacit consent
accorded supremacy to this landowning family in its
midst.</p>

<p>The Dadds by now had gone down, alas, in the
world; however, St. Eldred’s never dreamed of
making worldly prosperity a criterion for approval.
St. Eldred’s lived, itself, in a penurious prosperity or
a prosperous poverty; wealth, being unattainable, was
held to be undesirable as well as rather vulgar, and the
fading income of the Dadds only set the seal on their
title to general admiration. The farm was still theirs
indeed, but its yield was less and lessening. All through<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
the good old Protection days their corn had brought
high prices; but, unfortunately, the cost of living had
grown even higher in proportion, until the Dadds
found themselves forced to renounce agricultural
hopes, leave the farm fallow, and plunge into small
trade. From this they made a fair livelihood, and were
able to support their regal position in the world of
St. Eldred’s. So they lived, married, ruled, and died,
till never a house in St. Eldred’s but was kin to the
royal family of Dadd.</p>

<p>James Dadd after James Dadd contentedly took up
his sceptre, swayed it during his time, and laid it by.
Their clan, like all others in St. Eldred’s, was magnificently
complacent in contemplation of its own
position. No Dadd was ever heard to aspire to more
giddy worlds, no Dadd was ever known to show any
hankerings after wilder flights, after new courses, after
original thought or action of any kind. In a young
member of the family, in a collateral, the weight of
his elders would immediately have crushed out such
sparks of discontent; as for the head of the dynasty,
so surrounded was the ruling Dadd by now with
uncles, cousins, and aunts, not to mention dowagers of
bygone sovereigns, that it would have been as easy for
him to revolt as for a Pope to make headway against
the College of Cardinals. Such, then, was the decorous
state of affairs, when suddenly a most astonishing
thing happened.</p>

<p>The railway mania was sweeping over England.
Counties were being opened up, and landowners being
driven crazy with hysterical apprehensions of ruin,
and opposition to every threatened change. At first
all these commotions left the quiet waters of St.
Eldred’s unruffled. But eventually a railway company
came sniffing round the ancestral but profitless
farm of the Dadds, and, somehow, during the negotiations,<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
it was discovered that those barren acres covered
a coal-field of exuberant richness.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that this new fact should
bring about any sudden alteration in the feeling of
St. Eldred’s towards the Dadds. Only a mild flutter
agitated for a while the red-brick houses. Then it
was felt that the acquisition of wealth by the Dadds
was very right and proper. Wealth was only vulgar
when in new and plebeian hands. A Dadd could be
trusted to avoid giving offence, a Dadd would never
be ostentatious, nor presume to change his mode of
life. So, undeterred by any disapproval from their
peers, the ruling Dadds proceeded quietly to develop
their new possibilities. What those possibilities were
no one had the audacity or the grandeur of mind to
compute. Unsuspected, unrealized, volumes of money
rolled ceaselessly in to the account of the mine-owners,
while they, in their innocence, continued unperturbed
in the old simple ways, never caring to dream that their
new wealth could do more for them than add, at most,
a parlourmaid.</p>

<p>It was some years before even this grand addition
was made to their scale of living, and then it was only
when the sudden death of James Dadd the Eighth had
left the family sceptre in the hands of a queen-regent.
The widow ruled for her son (now, at a tender age,
raised to the rank of James Dadd the Ninth), and
hardly had she grasped the reins of power than she
began to show signs of wishing to use the abundant
resources which had now been accumulating for fifteen
years or more. Her ambitions were not approved,
and the extra parlourmaid was only condoned as an
indulgence for the sorrows of widowhood. But from
that moment a little rift began to widen between the
reigning Dadds and Darnley-on-Downe. The money
began insensibly to come between the rulers and the<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
ruled. It was inevitable that it should. An income&mdash;even
an unspent income&mdash;of fifteen thousand a year
cannot long live on terms of perfect friendly equality
with incomes of several hundred or so. The richer,
sooner or later, condescends; the poorer, sooner or
later, grudges. Thus it was in Darnley-on-Downe.
Even the suspicion that Mrs. Dadd had ‘notions’&mdash;that
she would have liked a landau, and had conceived
thoughts of sending her sons to Eton&mdash;caused
a certain vigilant enmity to exasperate the keenness
with which her every action was watched and weighed
by her council of relatives. The slightest sign of
ambition was soon marked as a treason to the clan.
All the Dadd connections, all the Dadd collaterals,
all the dowagers and younger branches of the Dadds
made common cause with St. Eldred’s, and joined in
the general suspicion with which the conduct of Mrs.
Dadd was viewed. The widow found herself unable
to carry out the smallest extravagance. Very innocent
and trifling were the few indulgences that she had
hoped for, but even these were put beyond her reach
by the decree of her relatives, by that incorruptible
synod over which even a Dadd queen-regent had no
more power than a doge of Venice over his Council of
Ten. Nor was her submission able to redeem her
popularity. The very fact of having once had ‘notions’
was enough to mark her out for ever as a traitor to the
Constitution of St. Eldred’s. She was no longer quite
‘one of themselves.’ The excommunication was pronounced
by those terrible princesses, the Misses
Adelaide and Minna Dadd, and no one was found to
question its justice as it thundered across the tea-table.</p>

<p>Inquiries were made into her remote ancestry, and
it was soon found that, though by birth an unblemished
Blessing, yet she had inherited the sinister tendencies<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
of a Messiter great-great-great-grandmother, whom
history convicted of eccentricities that went the
length of reading her Bible in French. From such a
tainted spring what purity could be expected? The
situation was summed up by the Misses Adelaide and
Minna Dadd. The stream cannot rise higher than its
source, was their stern pronouncement. A regretful
loyalty, a disapproving adherence now marked the
family’s attitude towards her&mdash;a loyalty, an adherence
as faithful but as disapproving as ever a virtuous
believer in Divine right can have felt for a drunken
and profligate Pretender, or a patriotic Catholic for
Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>So far, it is true, her eldest son, James Dadd the
Ninth, seemed a model of Dadd virtues. He had
made no open move towards ostentation and prodigality.
His younger brother Robert, however, was
the incarnate tragedy of St. Eldred’s, the incarnate
accusation of Mrs. Dadd’s regency. Briefly, this ulcer
of St. Eldred’s must be skimmed; Robert Dadd had
run away from home, and when next heard of, many
years later, was understood to be in Japan, and to
have become a Mormon or a Buddhist, or a disciple
of whatever religion rules in those benighted parts.
Never again was his name heard in St. Eldred’s, but
the Messiter great-great-great-grandmother was held
accountable for such a strange, terrible aberration&mdash;the
first break in the impeccable succession of the
Dadds. There was yet another child&mdash;a daughter&mdash;but
she was ten years younger than her brothers, and
could not as yet prove, in her own person, the corrupt
heredity of her mother. However, she was already
watched with care, and every tearing of her pinafore
was held symptomatic of inherited depravity.</p>

<p>James Dadd the Ninth came at last to his own, and
his unhappy mother, crushed by years of disapproval,<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
sank, unregretted, to the grave. And hardly had
St. Eldred’s consigned her decently to the tomb, than
James Dadd gave abundant proof of the evil spirit
that all his relatives had long suspected. He left
Darnley-on-Downe. He shut up the family house;
he travelled; he began timidly to live on a scale that
drove St. Eldred’s dizzy with horrified astonishment.
Thanks to his mother’s economy, he was now extremely
rich, and bit by bit began to realize the extent of his
opportunities. But, though St. Eldred’s shook its head
over him, though the Misses Adelaide and Minna Dadd
refused to read the papers any longer, for fear of
finding his iniquities chronicled, James Dadd remained
the true son of his fathers. Wealth could not
make him wealthy; it takes a generation at least to
make the genuine spendthrift, to ingraft the joy and
the splendour of purchasing. James Dadd remained
nervous, awkward, bourgeois in his uneasy enjoyment
of his money. Assertive one moment, he was uneasy
and parsimonious the next, always self-conscious,
always troubled by the disapproval of the only world
he really knew&mdash;the world that had made him and
written its signature large across the face of his personality.
Wherever he went, he carried St. Eldred’s,
and heard the mild but tremendous tones of the Misses
Adelaide and Minna Dadd among the arches of the
Colosseum as in the silences of the Desert. Sometimes
he defied the voices, sometimes he quailed before
them, but escape them he never could. He was out
of his sphere; they told him so. He had cast off his
own world, and could enter no other.</p>

<p>Often in his travels he met other men on similar
errands of pleasure, young men and old, sons of
country squires or illustrious families. In most cases
they had not a quarter of his income, but they seemed
to have the careless knack of getting more pleasure out<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
of half a crown than he could ever buy with a five-pound
note. Poor as they might be, generations of
spending ancestors had left them the secret of spending
easily, gaily, serenely, of letting money flow unperceived
between their fingers, of securing a double
return for their outlay through their very indifference
as to whether they ever got any return at all. This
was the whole distinction between himself and them.
Actual superiority of birth and breeding they had
none, though their forbears might be more prominent
than his. But centuries of inconspicuousness disqualify
a man for the conspicuous position conferred
by sudden wealth, and James Dadd, for all his long
pedigree, was far less fitted for his new place in life
than many a grandson of some successful politician
or lawyer, who might number, perhaps, two generations
to James Dadd’s twenty, but made up for this
lack of quantity by the eminence of the father and
grandfather whose high and hard-won position he
had painlessly inherited.</p>

<p>So James Dadd, misplaced and ill at ease, passed
thus through life with occasional spasmodic attempts
at the assumption of a defiant self-complacency. He
knew that he was an outcast from St. Eldred’s. Even
if he would, he could never now return to the red-brick
house of his early years. In the flesh, perhaps, he
might, but his spirit could never again be admitted
within its doors, could never again be admitted to
intimacy by the spirit of St. Eldred’s. Rashly he had
cut himself off from his own people, and must henceforth
face the fact. Nor, though either diffident or
vehement in the spending of his money, could he really
contemplate returning to the life of Darnley-on-Downe.
He had tasted of headier joys&mdash;tasted awkwardly,
perhaps, and incompletely, but even so the small-beer
on which St. Eldred’s had reared him must for evermore<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
be insipid to his palate. Though now he never
heard from his brother Robert, he sympathized with
his revolt, and resolved that he, too, could never again
have any part in the life of Darnley-on-Downe. And
at this point, just after the one brief tragic flash of
romance that broke into his life, he came across Lady
Kirk-Hammerton.</p>

<p>Lady Kirk-Hammerton was the sonless widow of
a second-rate Lord Chancellor. Devoid of wealth or
breeding, she and her husband had had recourse to
blatancy to emphasize their value. Now that he was
dead she redoubled the intensity of her methods, and
soon acquired that notoriety which she considered
synonymous with fame. Bereft of her husband,
there was no reason why people should ever take
notice of her again, unless her demeanour forced them
to do so. Therefore she set herself heroically to the
task of making her existence conspicuous in the eye
of the world, with such success that, with the best
resolve, nobody could succeed in ignoring her. Physically
and metaphorically, she shouted her way from
place to place, and her conversation blazed no less
obtrusively than her gowns. As for a foil, she felt
that her brilliancy needed none, and therefore had no
reason for tolerating her daughter’s incorrigible respectability.
With the more joy, therefore, did she
fall upon James Dadd at Naples, and hurl him, not
unwilling, into the company of her undesirable offspring.</p>

<p>But if the daughter emphasized the mother’s
mature and vehement charms, so did the mother’s
overwhelming presence show up the pale grace of the
daughter. Lady Adela Vayne-Kingston was pretty,
shrinking, mild, domestic&mdash;the very type that, in
happier circumstances, would have been most dear to
St. Eldred’s. She hated her mother’s loud voice and<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
louder manners; her one hope was to marry someone
obscure and gentle, who would remove her from the
burning atmosphere of Lady Kirk-Hammerton, in
whose train, since her girlhood, she had been dragged
hither and thither, never protesting, but always reluctant.
James Dadd, for his part, found in Lady
Adela a reminiscence of his old home-life. She seemed
to him the ghost of peaceful St. Eldred’s, with an
added touch of worldly experience and travelled charm.
Her character, far from repeating her mother’s, harked
back to some obscure ancestress, probably in domestic
service, and was so meek and placid as to be the very
incarnation of all that James Dadd had been brought
up to love and respect. On the other hand, this same
gentleness of temperament, which St. Eldred’s considered
the hall-mark of good breeding, was believed by
Lady Kirk-Hammerton to be especially distasteful to
those high circles after which she hankered; and she
had long, therefore, been eagerly seeking a chance to
be rid of the daughter whom her best efforts had failed
to render brazen and clamorous. Her delight, accordingly,
surpassed all bounds, when at the end of a week’s
acquaintance, James Dadd proposed to Lady Adela,
and was thankfully accepted.</p>

<p>Though the Misses Adelaide and Minna Dadd had
ceased to subscribe to ‘the Paper,’ they yet had their
recognised channels for the reception of news. For
the butcher conveyed the events of the world to their
cook, and she, in turn, laid edited selections before
her mistresses. In this way was brought to their
notice the approaching marriage between ‘James
Dadd, Esq., of Darnley-on-Downe, and the Lady
Adela Vayne-Kingston, daughter of the late Earl of
Kirk-Hammerton.’</p>

<p>That afternoon was hurriedly convened a great
meeting of the Dadd family to consider this announcement.<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
Unmixed disapproval filled every bosom in the
tribe. The engagement was held equivalent to the
abdication of James Dadd from the headship of his
race. In two ways the proposed marriage was disliked.
It was thoroughly unsuitable to a Dadd; it
was thoroughly unworthy of a Dadd. Lady Adela
was at once too high and too low to be a fair match
of James Dadd. Accident had given her a titular
position superior to her lover’s, while her birth was
in every way disastrously inferior to his own. Even St.
Eldred’s had heard something of Lady Kirk-Hammerton,
and it was impossible to imagine that her daughter
could, by any stretch of courtesy, be called a lady in
the true sense of the word. All the Dadd pride of
birth rose up against the thought of connection with
a girl without a grandfather&mdash;a girl, too, whom uninstructed
sections of the world might dare to consider
her husband’s social superior. It was felt that James
Dadd had inflicted a crowning insult on his family in
thus threatening to misally it. Mrs. John, Mrs.
Reuben, Mrs. Joshua, coincided in the opinion firmly
announced by the Misses Adelaide and Minna Dadd;
the young Johns, Reubens, and Joshuas, dissented in
nothing; only the peccant James’s sister, now a girl
of promising beauty, held her own counsel, and decided
to write congratulations to her brother and his destined
bride. For in her, too, the blood of great-great-great-grandmother
Messiter was at its fell work; her soul
longed for change and variety and gaiety; and all
these things she saw attainable through James’s
marriage with the daughter of that notorious Lady
Kirk-Hammerton.</p>

<p>But she was too wise to make her heresy public;
and the condemnation of James’s choice was passed
without protest by the assembled council. An ultimatum
was drafted by the Misses Adelaide and Minna<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
Dadd, and would have been dispatched on the morrow,
with the approval of all, had not the morrow brought
news that destroyed every hope of reconciliation with
the traitor. It was announced that, with royal permission,
James Dadd, of Darnley-on-Downe, would in
future be known as James Darnley. St. Eldred’s
gasped at the wickedness of this public repudiation.</p>

<p>In point of fact it was Lady Adela, gentle and
winning, whose vitality had stirred to a great effort,
under great pressure, and had risen to urge upon her
lover this change of name. She pointed out that to
ask a girl to become Lady Adela Dadd was to exact a
sacrifice as far beyond mortal power to grant as beyond
mortal justice to demand. James Dadd, recognising
that he could never hope to be reincluded in the clan
whose nominal sovereign he still was, found himself
inclined to consider Lady Adela’s plea in a favourable
spirit. Together they decided to adopt the more
euphonious name of Darnley, and James Dadd hastened
to make his decision public, that thus he might at once
be finally cut off from any remonstrances or embassies
of his family. He judged the temper of St. Eldred’s
rightly. His announcement was taken as an irremediable
declaration of war. His name was never mentioned
again in Darnley-on-Downe, except as that of
one deservedly dead and unregretted. The sceptre
passed into the capable hands of Mr. and Mrs. Reuben
Dadd, and by silent consent it was agreed that no
infant henceforth should bear the dishonoured names
of James or Robert. Only James Dadd’s young sister
remained hopefully loyal to his memory, and when, a
year later, the redoubled severity of the Misses Adelaide
and Minna Dadd alone betrayed their secret knowledge
that a son had been born to Mr. and Lady Adela
Darnley, the one acknowledgment of the event that
reached the outlaw from Darnley-on-Downe was a<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
surreptitiously-posted letter of his sister’s. If anything
could have aggravated the wrath of the Misses
Adelaide and Minna Dadd it would have been the
knowledge that the infant, that their own great
nephew, had been christened, not James, but Kingston.</p>

<p>Kingston Darnley, indeed! There was a name for a
child! You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow’s
ear, said the Misses Adelaide and Minna Dadd; and
they were universally felt to have expressed the situation
in all its bearings. And thus, from years of corrupting
wealth and secret disloyalty, was generated the
culminating disgrace of the Dadds, in Kingston Darnley.
Kingston Darnley!</p>

<p>Why, why had great-great-great-grandfather Blessing
married a Messiter of eccentric tendencies? And
what a curse is money! Better decorum and a competence
than stalled peacocks and a marriage with the
daughters of Heth! It became the fashion in St.
Eldred’s to affect, by contrast, a greater poverty than
the circumstances of anyone necessitated. To give
two cakes at tea became vulgar, and the Misses
Adelaide and Minna Dadd took to going to church with
only one Prayer Book between them. Nothing could
have induced St. Eldred’s to confess that it knew
anything of the Darnleys, and the various steps in
Lady Adela’s progress were sternly ignored by a
watchful world. Even when Mr. and Lady Adela
Darnley entertained a Princess for some charitable
function, the only comment made in St. Eldred’s was
the tacit one involved in the simultaneous retirement
to bed of the Misses Adelaide and Minna Dadd.
Another outcast, however, was soon added to James
and Robert&mdash;another topic for the silence of St.
Eldred’s. For, after some secret correspondence,
James Darnley’s sister eloped from the care of her
aunts, and was next heard of under the wing of her<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
brother’s wife in London. Within a year she had
married a stockbroker of abundant wealth. The lips
of St. Eldred’s snapped on this fulfilment of the
disasters brought about by great-great-great-grandmother
Messiter. The old dynasty of Dadd was ended
in Darnley-on-Downe. The main royal line was wiped
out, and the Reuben Dadds reigned in its stead.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>


<p>The new-made Darnleys, James and his sister, were
triumphantly ushered into the upper world by Lady
Adela, whose father’s rise, whose mother’s persistence,
had won at last a reluctant toleration from her betters.
Accustomed from her birth to live on terms of acquaintance
with more or less interesting or conspicuous
people, Lady Adela had developed something of that
native air and ease which James Dadd had never been
able to acquire in all his long exile from his own social
hemisphere. Nor did James Dadd, transformed into
James Darnley, ever succeed in fitting himself perfectly
to his altered conditions. His wife, besides loving him
devotedly, if placidly, did all she could to acclimatize
him; she made him buy a vast new house on the
Yorkshire moors; she filled it with people, she made her
husband play the squire; but to the last this man of
many descents remained less adaptable, less congenial
to his new environment than many a versatile Hebrew
whom twenty years of unlimited wealth transform
into what is nowadays considered a very tolerable
imitation of an English gentleman&mdash;especially as seen
on the stage. Among people who talked of money and
diseases with a freedom that struck him as indecent,
James Darnley, brought up to think both topics unmentionable,
remained timid and uncomfortable to<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
the end of his days, and when at last a combination of
dyspepsia and a Primrose League banquet caused him
to retire from a world in which he had always been a
stranger, even Lady Adela felt that he was somehow
set free from a long bondage. Gentle in her grief as
in all her other emotions, she resigned herself to becoming
crapes, and found new pleasure in the guardianship
of her son Kingston, now turned eleven.</p>

<p>But if James Darnley, first of his line, died a failure,
far otherwise was it with his sister. In her the blood
of great-great-great-grandmother Messiter must have
seethed and boiled with concentrated virulence, for
she took to her new life with a zeal that left nothing to
be desired, and soon dropped behind her all trace and
all memory of Darnley-on-Downe. Her manners, from
the first, were forward and easy; her ambition was to
be considered a woman of fashion, and she carried to
its accomplishment a temperament entirely devoid of
bashfulness or indecision. Mr. Mimburn, her wealthy
stockbroker husband, soon shrank into mere cheque-signing
obscurity beside the flaming figure of his wife.
Her remarks were quoted, her gowns described; she
became at last, in those far-off days, a precursor of
that modern type of woman who is perfectly virtuous,
except in dress, manners, and mind. Nothing would
have horrified her more than illicit proposals, except
the accusation of being shocked by them; nothing
have more appalled her than an attack on her virtue,
except the suspicion that she had any.</p>

<p>Her gossip always made a point of flirting round
impropriety, and she was at pains to damn her own
flawless character by arch implications. She had
cultivated French, and now was a walking chronicle
of the demi-monde, as well as a living picture of
its most prominent inhabitants. A passport to
her friendship was the possession of a past, and she<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
hastened to attribute amorous adventures to all her
dearest friends on any foundation or none. The
foundation did not matter; the point was that the
suggestion glorified them in her eyes; part of her
admiration for Lady Adela arose from the fact that
she suspected that saintly woman of having ‘consoled
herself’ during the lifetime of the late James
Darnley. Mrs. Mimburn’s knowledge of her sister-in-law’s
untried and incorruptible virtue was never
allowed to interfere with this romantic possibility; in
the face of all probability, in the face of all evidence,
she must imagine some such episode in any career
that touched her own, or else immediately cease to
take any interest in it. So far had she travelled from
the mental chastity that ruled in Darnley-on-Downe.</p>

<p>So, between mother and aunt, the young Kingston
Darnley journeyed through boyhood to maturity.
Lady Adela was an ideal parent, and discharged her
maternal duties with a gentle ease that made her son’s
progress altogether pleasant. She was one of the
cushion-women whose numbers nowadays are yearly
diminishing. Without initiative, without any clearness
of mind, she had the placid receptivity that often
accompanies such a temperament. The lack of colour
in her own character made it harmonious and restful
as a background to more vivid personalities. Therefore,
without effort or desire on her part, she attracted
confidence. She was good to lean on; she listened
well&mdash;though often without hearing, and always without
understanding. But her sweet acquiescence gave
everyone the idea of being fully comprehended, and
her incapacity for independent action added to her
value as a recipient of confidences. She could be
trusted to say little and do less; and the large majority
who, in making confession, only desire a sympathetic
listener, felt that Lady Adela was an altogether soft<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
and comfortable personality to repose against. What
more could be required? The faithful adviser frequently
gives much less, and is, as a rule, much less
valued than the imperturbable Lady Adelas of life.
Kingston Darnley was universally held to be highly
fortunate in his mother, and, by the time he came of
age, as he had neither married an actress nor gone to
ruin on the turf, her skill in managing him was considered
marvellous, and even beyond what might
reasonably have been expected.</p>

<p>‘I assure you, La-la, considering what young men are
nowadays, I do think you have done wonders,’ said
Mrs. Mimburn, who had called to congratulate her
sister-in-law on the latest triumph achieved by her
diplomacy.</p>

<p>‘Kingston is the dearest child,’ acknowledged Lady
Adela, deprecating undue flattery of her own genius.
‘One only needs to guide him. He is all obedience.
I have never attempted to drive him, Minnie.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn tossed her head. Her name was
always a sore point. She had suffered heavily in the
matter at the hands of her parents, who had christened
her Minna Adelaide, after her great-aunts of
formidable memory, the Misses Adelaide and Minna
Dadd. Understanding that such names were a grievous
handicap to any runner in the race of fashion, and
desirous, too, of obliterating all traces of Darnley-on-Downe,
Mrs. Mimburn did the best she could to remedy
the disaster by resolutely calling herself ‘Minne-Adélaïde.’
This Gallicism Lady Adela could never
bring herself to remember, and embittered the life of
her sister-in-law by calling her Min or Minnie when
in a good temper, or plain Minna on the very rare
occasions when she happened to be in not so good a
one.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ tartly replied Mrs. Mimburn, with another<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
toss of her plumed head, ‘I think you have been
wise, La-la. But you need not be too sure of Kingston.
There isn’t any reason to believe, La-la, that even <em>your</em>
son is not made of flesh and blood. Such stories one
hears! And a mother is the last person a boy could
think of confiding in. Depend upon it, you don’t
know everything. Boys don’t let their mothers marry
them off at Kingston’s age unless there is a reason for
it. Dear me! of course not; everyone loves a little
bit of freedom,’ concluded Mrs. Mimburn, filling her
voice with the suggestion of a wicked past.</p>

<p>Lady Adela had the happy knack of never hearing
anything that displeased her. The process of years
had brought her a sweet serenity that nothing could
ruffle. Whatever happened Lady Adela smiled.</p>

<p>‘Dear boy,’ she answered reflectively, without any
symptom of having noticed her sister-in-law’s remarks,
‘dear, dear boy! he has always been as free as air.
And he has been so good about the engagement.
Min, you know, five-and-twenty is such a charming
age for a man to settle. If one waits longer the nice
girls of one’s own age have all got married off, and one
has to put up with an elderly one, or a widow, or
something dreadful like that.’</p>

<p>‘Or something even worse,’ supplemented Mrs.
Mimburn, with a smile of worldly knowledge. She
was looking most typical that afternoon. She was a
little round dark woman, with deep, luscious eyes, and
more black hair than Nature had provided. Her gown
was of brown velvet, adorned with an incalculable
number of ruckings, tuckings, ruchings, quillings,
flutings, flouncings, rosettes, and insertions. Her
parasol lost its outline in a foam of scarlet, and her
brown tricorne hat, with its one enormous geranium-coloured
plume, was worn at an audacious tilt, in exact
imitation of that assumed by Marie de Lorraine in the<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
second act of ‘Mélanges du Divorce.’ That gorgeous
lady, whose notoriety almost passed into fame, was
Mrs. Mimburn’s favourite model. She had constituted
herself the especial chronicler of Marie de Lorraine,
copied her clothes devotedly, bought every scent
and powder that bore her name, and collected her
anecdotes, apocryphal or unpublishable, with as much
enthusiasm as a pious Pope accumulates relics. While
the hat recalled ‘Mélanges du Divorce,’ the parasol
to-day was based on that in ‘Infidèle,’ the gown
was collated from two that appeared in ‘Messalineries,’
the tippet’s prototype had figured in ‘Autour de
Mitylène,’ and the Parisian pearls that twined round
Mrs. Mimburn’s throat had been specially copied from
the historic necklace which her heroine had extracted
from Prince Henri de Valois, to the general scandal of
Europe. Even in the matter of cosmetics Mrs. Mimburn
was faithful to her model, and her rich complexion
glowed like a plum behind its bloom through a skin-tight
mask of Blanc de Perle ‘Marie,’ while her ruby
lips owed their flamboyancy of tint to the Vermeil de
Lorraine.</p>

<p>Lady Adela looked at her across the tea-table with
a kind smile. She felt that her sister-in-law added
colour to the room. Lady Adela was one of those
women whose habitations have a certain cool tonelessness
that matches their own character, and, like
their disposition, suits with any tint that may be
introduced. Her boudoir was nondescript and mild
in scheme; pale, sweet flowers stood here and there
in transparent glasses, and the summer light flowed in,
pale and ghostly, through the lowered white silk
blinds. Entrenched behind china and silver, Lady
Adela seemed the incarnation of the room’s spirit;
she also had the same indefinable pale sweetness. Her
gown was grey, her abundant beautiful hair snow-white,<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
her features were filled with a gentle complacency.
Altogether she irresistibly called to mind
an old white rabbit&mdash;a very soft, very fluffy, very
reverend and lovable old white rabbit.</p>

<p>‘Dear Min,’ she said at last, ‘you have no notion
what a comfort this engagement is to me.’</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Mimburn bridled. Why could La-la
never realize the difference between Min and Minne?</p>

<p>‘Ah, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma chère</i>,’ she replied, ‘indeed, it must be.
And you certainly have done wonders. It is not every
mother who can say that her son has never given her
an hour’s anxiety in his life, and ended up by marrying
the very first girl that she picked out for him.’</p>

<p>‘Never an hour’s anxiety,’ repeated her sister-in-law,
always behindhand in a conversation. ‘No, dear
Min; I can truly say that ever since Kingston had
diphtheria at school he has never given me another
hour’s anxiety. And they said afterwards that that
was only some other kind of sore throat. But it was
quite as alarming at the time, I remember. Anyhow,
since then the dear boy has been everything I
could wish.’</p>

<p>‘It makes him sound terribly dull,’ commented Mrs.
Mimburn. ‘Now, I like a boy to be a little bit naughty
myself&mdash;a&mdash;well, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bêtise</i> now and then, you know.’</p>

<p>‘There is nothing of <em>that</em> kind about my son, Minna,’
protested Lady Adela in a momentary spasm of dignity.
Mrs. Mimburn, as in duty bound, had, of
course, suspicions that her nephew was not all he had
the tact to seem. But she was anxious to hear details
of his engagement, and therefore waived the question
of young men’s iniquity, which she was usually inclined
to treat with a wealth of illustrations and many
anecdotes from the career of Marie de Lorraine.</p>

<p>‘But tell me about Gundred Mortimer, La-la,’ she
said. ‘I have never met her. What is she like?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>Lady Adela warmed into the expression of a more
positive enthusiasm than she usually showed.</p>

<p>‘Min,’ she answered, ‘Gundred is absolutely the
dearest of creatures. Everything that is nice. I
really feel that I have quite found a daughter&mdash;thoroughly
well brought up, and charming manners,
and truly religious, which is such a great thing nowadays.
Not at all forward or fashionable, but just a
steady, old-fashioned, good girl. I am sure you will
love her, Min.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn began, on the contrary, to conceive a
strong dislike for the future Mrs. Darnley&mdash;a dislike
tempered only by the hope that she might be found to
have had a mystery in her life.</p>

<p>‘Quite a bread-and-butter miss,’ she tittered.</p>

<p>‘Do have some more, Min,’ pleaded Lady Adela,
with apparent irrelevance, exercising her usual happy
power of ignoring unfavourable comment. ‘Yes,
nothing could be luckier in every way. She is the
very wife I should have chosen for dear Kingston.
She will make him perfectly happy. And now, Min, I
do really feel that my work is finished. It has been a
great responsibility, you know, having sole charge of
a son all these years. There are so many dangers.
Mercifully, he has always had confidence in me, and I
have been able to keep him away from everything undesirable.
But, of course, as time goes on, one gets
to feel more and more anxious. You can say what
you like, but it isn’t always easy to understand young
men. Even a mother’s sympathy finds it difficult
sometimes.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn had a very terse answer to the riddle
of young-manhood. Human nature presented no
mysteries to her mind; woman was the solution of them
all. She sniffed knowingly.</p>

<p>‘I think <em>I</em> could manage it, La-la,’ she replied.<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
‘However, you are marrying off Kingston, and that is
the great thing. I suppose he is very much in love?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very, very, even before I suggested it. And
she adores him, of course. I saw that long ago. But
dear Kingston is so simple and good, he had no idea
until I told him.’</p>

<p>‘And he proposed&mdash;when? Yesterday?’</p>

<p>‘After lunch, dear Min. I asked Gundred on purpose,
and we had some really delightful Caviare biscuits.
And then I managed to leave them in the drawing-room&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;it
came off, dear Min. I am so pleased.’</p>

<p>‘What does Mr. Mortimer say, La-la?’</p>

<p>‘Naturally he is charmed, Minna. What should he
be? Besides, nobody cares much what Mr. Mortimer
says. But his dear aunt, Lady Agnes, is quite on our
side. In fact, you may imagine that she and I talked
it all out between us.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn laughed.</p>

<p>‘What an obedient boy Kingston must be,’ she said.
‘Had he nothing to say in the matter?’</p>

<p>‘Kingston trusts to his mother to know best,’
answered Lady Adela with gentle dignity. ‘Gundred
is altogether pretty and good and sweet, so what more
could he want? Besides, as I pointed out to him&mdash;and
he quite understood&mdash;such a marriage will be a
great help to him in his career, when he finds one.’</p>

<p>‘But Mr. Mortimer is very silly, surely,’ protested
Mrs. Mimburn. ‘How can he be a help to anyone?’</p>

<p>‘One shouldn’t be harsh,’ replied Lady Adela, ‘and
I am sure when he succeeds to the dukedom nobody
will think him as foolish as they do now.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn was still in a carping mood.</p>

<p>‘The Duke himself is actually an imbecile, isn’t
he?’ she asked. ‘How dreadful to marry into a
family where there is madness, La-la! A mad,
ga-ga&mdash;great-uncle, isn’t it? Yes. Poor Gundred!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>However, Lady Adela refused, as always, to take
any but a hopeful view.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ she said, ‘we must trust that it will all be
for the best. And there is a little insanity in my own
family, too, Min, so that will make us quite quits, won’t
it? No; the only thing I do regret is that dear Gundred
has not got more relations. You see, Lady Agnes
has never married, and Gundred is an only child herself,
so that really poor Kingston will hardly have got
so many nice new connections as I could have wished.
There was an Isabel Mortimer, I am told, an aunt of
Gundred’s, but they don’t talk about her. She
married a New Zealander, or something dreadful, and
went out there and died. I forget if she left any children,
but of course it can’t matter whether she did or
not.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn scented romance, and immediately
became more friendly towards the match.</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, poor thing!’ she said. ‘We all have our
temptations. I should be the last to blame anybody.
Life teaches one to understand, La-la. It’s not Miss
Gundred’s fault. Probably it runs in the blood. These
things do. You know Marie de Lorraine’s mother
used to drink methylated spirits, and they say she
herself can never act unless&mdash;well, dear me, these
things are very odd, aren’t they?’</p>

<p>Lady Adela was not listening; she rarely did listen
to anyone, and never to Mrs. Mimburn. ‘Yes,’ she
said, returning on her tracks. ‘I spoke to dear
Kingston quite plainly. I told him that such an
opportunity would never come in his way again. And
after all, it is something to make a good marriage
nowadays. And I said to him how delighted I should
be if he would take it. He was so nice about it. I
am sure he had been in love with Gundred all the while.
I know he used to say how pretty and sweet she was.<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
Anyhow, he made no sort of difficulty, and they will
be married at the end of the season.’</p>

<p>‘What an anxiety off your mind!’ cried Mrs. Mimburn,
giggling archly.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied Lady Adela gravely. ‘One wants
one’s son to settle down; and, of course, one likes
cleverness well enough in other people, but in one’s
own children one can really have too much of it. When
it came to Kingston’s telling me he thought it wrong
to shoot grouse, I knew it was time to see him safely
married. Grouse are so truly excellent. It always
happens, I am sure. If a young man does not marry
early in life he becomes clever, and gets into every kind
of uncomfortable fad. But Gundred will prevent and
cure all that, I am quite sure. She is so religious and
good, dear Min, as I told you; she will have no patience
with humanitarianism and all those dreadful fashionable
crazes. Humble and simple and devout, Min&mdash;just
the wife that dear Kingston wants. I have never
been really anxious about him, I need not say, but I
certainly was beginning to think it time he fell into
the hands of some nice sensible girl or other.’</p>

<p>Mental aberrations never interested Mrs. Mimburn.
Her curiosity was confined to the vagaries of the flesh.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well,’ she said, ‘that will wear off, you know,
all that nonsense. You may be thankful it was nothing
worse. Most young men&mdash;ah, well! One must be
grateful that Kingston never got into the clutches of
Marie de Lorraine, for instance. She is such a terror.
Even her garters, you know, diamonds and pearls.
Oh, dear me, how delightful life would be, wouldn’t
it, if one didn’t have to be good?’</p>

<p>‘Men,’ continued Lady Adela in a ruminant manner,
‘are always a little puzzling at the best of times. Even
if they seem perfectly satisfactory in every way they
are quite liable to break out sometimes into most<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
extraordinary freaks. One can never tell. Though dear
Kingston is as quiet as anyone could possibly be, I do
feel that it is satisfactory to get him settled so nicely.’</p>

<p>‘As you say,’ admitted Mrs. Mimburn knowingly,
‘one can never tell. The strangest things one hears!
Quite old men, too&mdash;so very funny! There was Lord
Bennington; they say he wanted to run away with
Marie de Lorraine&mdash;seventy, if he is a day, La-la, and
eight grandchildren. Dear me, yes; one can never
prophesy what a man will do. Only be ever so little
polite to one, and the next minute&mdash;well, I suppose
it is human nature, after all.’ She sighed coyly, as
one whose virtue is for ever being besieged.</p>

<p>‘Even my own dear husband,’ continued Lady Adela,
‘the best and most devoted of men, had had his
moments of madness&mdash;really, one can call it nothing
else, can one, Min? You remember how good and
orderly James always was? Nothing seemed able to
excite him, and though I am sure he loved me most
warmly, still&mdash;well, it wasn’t at all <em>public</em>, Minnie.
And yet, you know, there was a Frenchwoman, or
something dreadful like that, whom James quite lost
his head over, so I am told, before he met me. Perfectly
crazy, they say he was, and when she was
drowned he wanted to commit suicide. Now, could
anything sound more unbelievable, Min?’</p>

<p>‘I have heard about it,’ replied Mrs. Mimburn;
‘one of those ridiculous affairs I was talking of. Poor,
sober, straightforward, stodgy, bourgeois James, and
some terrible creature with padded hips and a French
walk. That is just what happens. Your nonconformist,
your decent provincial, always gets caught by
the most brazen <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">horizontale</i>. James was absolutely
idiotic about it, so people told me&mdash;met her&mdash;now,
where did he meet her?&mdash;anyway, he suddenly made
himself more absurd than a schoolboy&mdash;and I could<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
tell you stories of <em>them</em>, La-la&mdash;fell in love with her
at first sight, and talked the most amazing nonsense
you can imagine. She was his affinity, if you please,
the other half of his soul, the lost love of a century ago.
And all this from sober old James. She must have
been a shameless creature, too&mdash;but they always are,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ces dames</i>; for she seems to have met him&mdash;well,
quite half-way, and encouraged his monstrous craze.
And then she was most mercifully drowned, and after
a week of sheer madness, James calmed down into his
right mind again, and was only too glad to marry a
nice quiet girl like you, La-la. Now, that just shows.
If there ever was a person whom one would have
thought perfectly safe from a passion like that, the
person was our decent, beef-eating James. But no,
one can never count on a man. Nine out of ten of the
men we marry, however placid and devoted they may
be, have had some dreadful insane romance in their
lives, La-la. One knows what it is to be a man’s
romance one’s self, and, dear me, it’s not by any
means the same thing as being a man’s wife!’</p>

<p>‘Such a sad, dreadful story,’ commented Lady
Adela comfortably, taking no notice of Mrs. Mimburn’s
artful, question-courting sighs. ‘And to think of its
happening to James, too. Do you know, Min, he
always wore black for that woman on the twentieth
of July. So stuffy of him, in the hot weather!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, my dear La-la, trust a man always to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">afficher</i>
himself in the most ridiculous way he can.’</p>

<p>‘Minna, do you think Kingston is at all like his
father?’</p>

<p>‘My dear La-la, all men are alike. Let us trust
that Kingston’s marriage will prevent him from
playing the fool like that, though.’</p>

<p>‘Minnie, do you know Kingston sometimes seems
to me so like his father that I am almost frightened.<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
And yet he is quite different, which makes it all the
odder. Somehow, his father seems to look over
Kingston’s shoulder at me from time to time, and every
now and then I hear poor James’s voice distinctly in
something Kingston says. And yet they are two quite
different people. Isn’t it uncanny? I take quinine
for it, Minnie. And I know dear James is safe in
heaven, of course, but yet I can never quite help
feeling that the father and son are the same in some
mysterious way. And that is so uncomfortable, Min.
One does like to think that people are really dead
when they have been buried. It seems so much more
proper, somehow.’</p>

<p>Exhausted by her effort of subtlety, Lady Adela
sighed and poured more water into the teapot. Meanwhile
Mrs. Mimburn was growing impatient.</p>

<p>‘Well, dear La-la,’ she said, ‘Kingston is just a man.
That’s all the likeness there is between him and his
father. It is the male element you feel in both. No
woman can help feeling it&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voilà ce qui donne les
frissons</i>. And now, La-la, I seem to have been a perfect
age, and, really, I ought to be going on. Do you
think Kingston and Gundred are likely to be in soon?
Because I did want to see her, and it is getting so late
that I can hardly spare more than another minute or
two.’</p>

<p>Lady Adela looked helplessly at the clock.</p>

<p>‘The play surely must be over by now,’ she answered.
‘Do wait, Minnie. They will be here any time now.’</p>

<p>‘What has he taken her to this afternoon?’</p>

<p>‘“La Tosca.” It sounds a very dreadful sort of
play, and not at all one to take a nice girl to. But
dear Kingston has always been interested in literature
and things like that, so I suppose he wants to interest
dear Gundred in them, too. There are such pretty
books nowadays; I never can see what people want<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
with clever ones. However, I do think Gundred will
cure dear Kingston. She has the sweetest, simplest
tastes. We agree in everything.... Ah, there they
are,’ broke off Lady Adela in tones of triumph, as if
the return of the lovers were a personal achievement
of her own. Mrs. Mimburn rose, diffusing an eddy of
Peau de Marie as she did so.</p>

<p>‘Just a moment,’ she announced, ‘and then I must
fly. I must, indeed.’ She gathered herself into a
welcoming posture, picturesquely assumed the parasol,
and stood with protruded hips to watch the opening of
the door and the entrance of her nephew’s future wife.</p>

<p>Miss Mortimer had clearly no false bashfulness about
confronting and challenging the approval of her future
husband’s family. Sedately and collectedly she came
into the room, greeted Lady Adela, and then underwent
the introduction to Mrs. Mimburn. Her lover
followed close upon her track&mdash;tall, fair, handsome,
radiant, his manner filled with proprietary joy.</p>

<p>Miss Mortimer might be recognised at first glance as
the very fine flower of that type which, after all, even
Lady Adela only copied. From head to foot her
appearance and bearing proclaimed that she belonged
to a class that had ruled unquestioned for many generations.
She was very neat, placid, clear-cut in dress,
build, and demeanour, an elegant, tiny figure, unalterably,
coldly perfect in every detail. Everything
about her was exactly as it should be, from the elaborate
neatness of her pale golden hair to the nice grace with
which she accepted Mrs. Mimburn. Her manners, her
smile, were consciously faultless, and she radiated the
impression of imperturbable good breeding. She was,
in fact, a crisp and charming specimen of that type
which develops later into neat-featured peeresses with
royalty fringes, violet toques, and short cloaks of
sable or mink. It was easy to see how she had attracted<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
Lady Adela. The two women had ease, gentleness,
placidity in common. But there the resemblance
stopped. Miss Mortimer’s mind was as definite, as
clear, as simple as her appearance; she had none of
that soft vagueness which characterized Lady Adela;
her decisions were as swift and firm as their expression
was gentle and well bred; one could divine in her the
immovable obstinacy of one who is never violent or
angry, but always unchangeably certain that he is
right. As she smiled upon Mrs. Mimburn’s congratulatory
fondlings, she conceived an instantaneous
dislike for that over-decorated woman, and had no
difficulty in feeling sure that her disapproval was
righteous.</p>

<p>‘Call me Minne,’ Mrs. Mimburn was saying effusively,
gladly conscious that she was making a highly favour-impression
on the bride-elect. ‘Always remember to
call me Minne.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn had never allowed her nephew to
emphasize her age by calling her aunt, and saw no
reason for delaying to make the situation clear to her
prospective niece.</p>

<p>‘So kind,’ murmured Gundred, smiling into Mrs.
Mimburn’s eyes, and noticing the heavy rings of bistre
that enhanced their charms. Then she turned to
Lady Adela.</p>

<p>‘Just one cup of tea, dear Lady Adela, if I may?
And then, really, I must be getting home. Kingston
and I have been having the most delightful afternoon,
but papa will be thinking I have been run over, or
something terrible. And I sent the carriage home, too.’</p>

<p>Lady Adela poured her out a cup of tea, and Kingston
Darnley offered it to her with due devotion.</p>

<p>‘No, dear, no sugar,’ said Gundred gently, repulsing
his offer. ‘You forget, I never take sugar.’ His
ardour was such that he persisted in plying her with<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
all good things; hers was such that she expected him
to remember minutely all her preferences and dislikes.
Accordingly, her clear, sweet voice conveyed a hint of
reproach.</p>

<p>‘And have you enjoyed the play, dear?’ asked
Lady Adela.</p>

<p>‘Very wonderful,’ replied Gundred. ‘But so painful,
Lady Adela. I cannot see why they should want
to perform such painful things. There is so much
beauty in life&mdash;yes? So why should we look at the
ugly things?’</p>

<p>‘It’s all in the day’s work,’ suggested Kingston
Darnley. ‘Beauty as well as ugliness. One has to
face both in life.’</p>

<p>‘But beauty can never be ugly,’ answered Gundred,
‘and art only deals with beauty&mdash;&mdash;’ Her calm tones
carried the conviction of perfect certitude, and flattened
out the conversation like a steam-roller.</p>

<p>She was too pretty, however, for such syllogisms to
be as daunting as they might have been from the lips
of a plainer woman. Kingston contemplated the
speaker with a pleasure that obliterated all close consideration
of the thing spoken.</p>

<p>‘I like a play with plenty of passion in it,’ announced
Mrs. Mimburn. ‘English plays are so absurdly
mealy-mouthed. These things exist, and, really, the
whole of life is wonderfully interesting. And yet
English writers leave out the most exciting half of
everything. Why, for my own part, as soon as I have
read the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haut goût</i> parts in a book, I take no further
interest in the story.’</p>

<p>‘It is all a matter of taste, I suppose&mdash;yes?’
answered Gundred, her cold tone implying that it
was a matter of good taste and bad, and that on the
point her own was as good as Mrs. Mimburn’s was
bad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>‘Some women like to pretend that they are not
flesh and blood,’ began Mrs. Mimburn.</p>

<p>Clearly, sweetly, decisively, Gundred interposed.</p>

<p>‘Dear Lady Adela,’ she said, ‘really, you make the
very best tea that anyone could imagine. And it is
such a rare art nowadays. But, do you know, I must
not stay another minute. Poor papa will be getting
quite anxious. Kingston dear, you may get me a
hansom if you like, but I cannot let you come with
me. Your mother will almost forget she ever had a
son. You must stay with her and tell her about that
dreadful play.’</p>

<p>‘Look here, do let me come with you,’ pleaded
Kingston. ‘I hardly feel to have seen you at all to-day.
I want to talk to you.’</p>

<p>‘Dear boy,’ smiled Gundred, ‘you have just had
three and a half hours of my company.’</p>

<p>‘In a stuffy theatre, with four hundred people
looking on the whole time. Besides, one can’t talk&mdash;<em>really</em>
talk, in a theatre. It isn’t really being together,
sitting side by side in the stalls. One might as well
be with one’s grandmother, for all one is able to say.
There are ever so many things I haven’t had a chance
of saying to you. Take me home with you, Gundred,
and let me dine with you.’</p>

<p>Gundred shook her head. ‘Impossible, dear,’ she
answered decidedly. ‘We have got people coming, and
it would put the table out. You may run in to lunch
to-morrow, though. And now, may he ring for a
hansom, Lady Adela?’</p>

<p>But at this point Mrs. Mimburn intervened with an
urgent plea that Gundred should let herself be driven
home in Mrs. Mimburn’s carriage.</p>

<p>‘Now, do, dearest Gundred,’ pleaded Mrs. Mimburn,
nerving herself to the inevitable audacity of calling
the new niece by her Christian name. Then she<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
fetched her breath in a gasp of relief, and went on.
‘Our horses go like the wind, and you will be home in
a flash&mdash;an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclair</i>, a positive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclair</i>.’</p>

<p>To Gundred’s British mind the word merely suggested
confectionery, and the proposal, as emanating
from Mrs. Mimburn, was altogether distasteful. She
smiled a cordial refusal. But Mrs. Mimburn pressed
her point.</p>

<p>‘We must really see something of each other, dear,’
she went on, ‘now we are to be relations. A cosy
little drive together, now, don’t say no. I shall be
quite offended if you do.’ Mrs. Mimburn persisted
until Gundred saw that there was no hope of being
able decently to decline the offer.</p>

<p>‘You are so kind,’ she said. ‘Well, if you are really
sure it will not be taking you out of your way? Kingston,
dear, may I have my parasol?’</p>

<p>He told her he had left it outside the door.</p>

<p>‘Where?’ asked Gundred. ‘Come and show me.’
Together they slipped out of the room, leaving Mrs.
Mimburn making her farewells to Lady Adela, and exchanging
comments.</p>

<p>‘But look here,’ protested Kingston, as they stood
on the landing, ‘why am I not to see you again till
to-morrow? Why shouldn’t I dine with you? Confound
the table, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Hush,’ said Gundred, but not sternly. ‘It really
would put the table out. And papa is so particular.
Besides’&mdash;she faltered for a moment&mdash;‘besides, Kingston
dear, I&mdash;I don’t want you to see too much of me
before we are married. You might&mdash;you might get
tired of me, you see.’ She raised her eyes and looked
full into his. In the smiling depths of her gaze might
have been seen the whole truth. Sedate, restrained,
correct, she loved her choice with a passion that no
one was allowed to guess from the cool suavity of her<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
usual demeanour. Only in stolen flashes of privacy
such as this was even Kingston permitted to realize
his triumph. Gundred lived, as a rule, in public;
every gesture, every inflection, was calculated to
satisfy that pervasive invisible arbiter whose approval
confirms its object’s title to ‘good form.’ Few and brief
were the moments in which she consented to be, in
body and spirit, alone with her lover. And rarely had
he time to grasp the concession, before the blessed
instant passed and Gundred slipped back into her cool,
normal self, hastily evasive, as if frightened of her own
self-revelation. So it was now. He heard her murmured
words on the cool, dim landing, saw the look in
her eyes, and realized her meaning. But as he caught
at her hands, and broke into a hot protest, the mask
flew back on to the girl’s face again. She reclaimed
her hands and busied herself in putting on her gloves.
It was the polite, public Gundred that stood before
him. To his contrast with her public self, so self-contained
and orderly, was due half the sweetness and the
charm of that shy wood-nymph soul that only allowed
itself to peep out at him so timidly and rarely. He saw
that the moment was over.</p>

<p>‘You are so demonstrative,’ said Gundred calmly.
‘And putting on one’s gloves is a serious matter. One
cannot do two things at once. And, oh, dear me! I
have never said good-bye to your mother.’</p>

<p>She slipped quickly back into the drawing-room
before he could stop her, and, as he remained outside,
playing disconcertedly with the tassel of her parasol, he
heard the well-known clear level tones taking a
daughterly farewell of Lady Adela. Then Mrs. Mimburn
emerged in such a roaring surf of silk petticoats
that other sounds became indistinguishable. She
squeezed her nephew’s hand.</p>

<p>‘A thousand congratulations,’ she whispered.<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
‘Charming, charming! Just the sort of girl that pays
for marrying. You will wake her up. She will be
quite a different creature when you have been married
a little while. I know that sleeping-beauty type of
girl.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn smiled darkly upon him, and put a
world of knowledge into her glance. But she had not
time to say more, for Gundred now appeared, and the
two women descended the stairs, exchanging civilities.
Kingston followed, to see them safely tucked into Mrs.
Mimburn’s elaborate victoria.</p>

<p>‘Lunch to-morrow; don’t forget,’ said Gundred, as
a last reminder. Then the carriage drove off, and
Kingston went upstairs again to his mother.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>


<p>To love is by no means necessarily to understand, and
Kingston Darnley, as Nature and life had moulded him,
was a very different character from Kingston Darnley
as his mother’s vague mind imagined him. In point of
fact she, good woman, knew little of her son but his
face, though, with the splendid intrepidity of the benevolent
stupid, she claimed an intimate acquaintance
with every detail of his being. Her complete ignorance
was due to no conscious process on either side; he as
little dreamt of concealing anything from her as she of
ignoring any quality in him. But time had taught
Kingston that whether he confided in his mother or
not, she was just as wise after the revelation as before,
being totally devoid of any power to understand what
she was shown, or, indeed, to realize that she was being
shown anything at all.</p>

<p>Kingston Darnley soon learned to lead his own life
without reference to his mother; to help by listening<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
was her province; to help by comprehending was
beyond the capacities of her nature. So Lady Adela
was left to dwell serene in the world of her own happy
little kindly fancies, while the facts of life went by her
in a roar, without ever being able to capture her notice.
She felt that never had mother been more loving or
more beloved; that never had son been more loyal
and devoted; her parental eye was fixed unerringly
on her child, and she knew his nature down to the
uttermost convolutions of its smallest eccentricity.
Did she ever forget that he disliked the smell of onions?
Had she ever failed to notice and deplore his coldness
towards her favourite clergy? And had she not succeeded
in the last, noblest, highest ambition of a
mother’s life&mdash;that of imposing upon him a thoroughly
nice and suitable bride? And he, for his part, had never
rebelled, never repined, never objected, not even to the
bride. Accordingly, Lady Adela felt proudly secure
that she understood her son in every fibre of his being.
So she smiled upon him with perfect unintelligence, and
gave nightly thanks to the Powers that had so gifted
her with the perfect tact of motherhood.</p>

<p>Kingston Darnley at one-and-twenty had found
himself a great deal older than his years. His contemporaries
were mere children. He had lived the
sheltered life at his mother’s side, until at last came the
belated time when she reluctantly permitted him to
go to Oxford without her shielding company. General
opinion&mdash;even that of her son&mdash;seemed opposed to
Lady Adela’s plan of taking lodgings in Holywell
Street, and thence keeping a mother’s eye upon her
child. And to popular opinion Lady Adela accordingly
yielded. She never made more than a mild and flabby
resistance, and could always be induced by opposition
to give up her most cherished plots with a smile. But
until Kingston, alone and undefended, set off one sad<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
October evening from Paddington, he had never been
allowed outside the sphere of his mother’s presence&mdash;one
can hardly say of his mother’s influence&mdash;for any
influence that Lady Adela may ever have had must
always have been merely that of kindly, null proximity.</p>

<p>However, reared by carefully-selected tutors in the
gentle but stifling atmosphere of a widow’s house, the
mind of Kingston Darnley had shot into premature
and unsuspected growth. Intelligence he would always
have had, but his training forced it into early development.
And, as the growing pains of the mind
are always painful as those of the body&mdash;especially if
experienced too soon or too keenly&mdash;so Kingston
suffered from the unseasonable expansion of his
thoughts, and his discomfort was increased, no less
than its cause, by the fact of his essential loneliness.
He had no one to speak to. On the first mention of
an idea, Lady Adela confidently diagnosed the need of
pills; and any perception of inequalities in this best
of all possible worlds must be treated by the purer air
of Brighton or Bournemouth.</p>

<p>So Kingston was driven in upon himself, and, by the
time he came of age, had ardently discovered all the
paradoxes that more fortunate people come to in due
time at twenty-five or so, and then are able to take
as platitudes. The injustice of wealth, the iniquities
of sport, of religion, of land-tenure&mdash;all these crimes
Kingston Darnley felt to be his own particular revelation,
and they fermented in his mind until he had few
thoughts in common with his fellows. They, meanwhile,
went placidly on their way, and when Kingston
arrived at Oxford, he found himself a stranger and
misplaced among the men of his own years. He was
filled at first with a gnawing, cavilling discontent that
arose as much from idleness and opulence as from too<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
rapid and unhealthy growth. They, for their part,
were honest, jolly fellows, who looked on discontent
as an uncomfortable and ‘bad-form’ thing, to be
strenuously frowned and jeered out of their circle.
To enjoy what came, without analysis, was their
scheme, and they resented being asked to inquire into
the reasonableness and the morality of their enjoyment.
At one-and-twenty no really sane creature
wants to think. The time for thought comes later,
when the first ardours of action are passing.</p>

<p>Kingston Darnley, though he had far too much sense
and geniality to preach or impose his ideas on anyone,
was felt to be always suggesting questions, never to be
accepting the joy of the moment, in a properly acquiescent,
youthful manner. And nothing is more
annoying to the hedonist, of whatever age, than the
companionship of someone who seems to be examining
the sources of his joy. It may be that no joys can
stand the test of reason, and the hedonist’s dislike of
the sceptic may gain its intensity from the hedonist’s
own unacknowledged realization of the fact. Even
when Kingston got drunk his tone of mind seemed
analytical, far removed from the frank, bellowing
joyousness of the more healthy enthusiasts round him.
They sat about in the Quad and howled, or beat baths
beneath the windows of the junior Dean; Kingston,
anxious to please, howled and beat baths with the best.
But, whereas the ebullition was pure nature and joy
of living with them, with him it was always an assumption,
a pose, no matter how carefully assumed and disguised.
And the consciousness of this was no less
galling to him than to them. All felt ill at ease, disconcerted,
disillusioned by his presence. His well-intentioned
hilarity seemed somehow to turn the gold
of their pleasure to brass, to strike a jarring note in
the chorale of enjoyment they were playing so whole-heartedly.<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
So, though never unpopular, Kingston
Darnley was isolated. His own set in the college did
not want to be bothered with the iniquitous why and
wherefore of the game-laws, or the manifest impossibility
of miracles; and the other sets to whom he would
have brought these discoveries in glad pride had grown
accustomed to them long ago, and for many years had
looked on them as the buried foundation-stones of all
reasoning. So that Kingston fell between two stools,
and must needs keep company with his ideas until the
passing of time should bring him level with the contemporaries
over whom his training had given him such
an unhealthy and fictitious advantage.</p>

<p>In any case it is hardly likely that he could ever have
taken any really intimate part in Oxford life. Training
or no training, his mind had that inquiring tone so
fatal to unreflecting hilarity. He was too much interested&mdash;in
the wrong things, too, and in the wrong
way&mdash;in people, in causes, in problems. The men who
should have been his friends were concerned almost
entirely with the joy of living and the avoidance of all
unnecessary work. And how is the son of a widow,
reared at home decorously, without other boys to riot
and tumble with&mdash;how is he to have any personal
enthusiasm for the joy of living, as understood by
healthier, normal men of his own age? Nor is the
precocious cleverness of the unquiet mind any real test
of ability. Few of Kingston Darnley’s contemporaries
but had as good an intelligence as his. Their brains,
however, developed naturally along the natural path.
In twenty years he had lived hurriedly through five-and-twenty
of feverish mental development; their
five-and-twentieth year&mdash;of mind no less than of body&mdash;still
lay well ahead of them. By the time he and
they would be thirty they might all, perhaps, be contemporaries
together. The unhealthy, straggling<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
shoots of his forced growth would have been blighted
down to a level with theirs, sturdy and natural; and
by the time they came to consider the game-laws and
the gospels, they would bring a ripe and genial intelligence
to bear on such points, neither thinking nor
talking in excess, but letting profitless points of doctrine
slide, for the sake of hitting on a sane and decent
scheme of living, such as can best be attained by the
average sensible gentleman’s compromise between
abstract justice and sound, everyday behaviour.</p>

<p>And Kingston himself would find, in the course of
years, that the rubs and jars of life would bring his
point of view to the same pitch as theirs, and would
perceive that thought is a frivolous and profitless indulgence
of the idle mind, as compared with the more
fruitful achievement of an honest man’s daily duty,
along the lines of obvious, rough-cast morality. Meanwhile,
however, though without conscious arrogance,
he realized his isolation, and viewed it alternately with
pride and regret. On the whole, as self-satisfaction is
the postulate of all human life, the pride predominated,
and he carried unconsciously through Oxford the idea
of being a chosen candlestick for spiritual light.</p>

<p>Other feelings, too, contributed to his sense of loneliness.
Birth and wealth had given him caste; but
custom had not yet trained him to it. From the
middle-class, staid traditions of Darnley-on-Downe he
had inherited several hereditary tendencies that not
the most determined efforts could eradicate. He was
conscious of them; they annoyed him, they disconcerted
him by making him feel more than ever
that he did not match his surroundings, and this
mortifying consciousness was unsupported by any such
heroic glamour as that which attended the independence
of his sceptical spirit. He knew that he was not careless
enough in the spending of money. Spend it he<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
did, freely and eagerly; but he always knew what it
had bought, and his mind kept accounts long after he
had fiercely broken himself away from the spell of
pass-books and schedules. This was not as it should
be. Money, to be spent correctly, should be scattered
loosely, and the spender should have as little idea as
possible of the way in which it has gone. Only thus
can a well-bred indifference to finance be attained.
The ideal of his contemporaries was to be perpetually
in debt, and never to have anything whatever to show
for all that had been spent. On four hundred or four
hundred and fifty a year right-minded people might
attain to complete destitution, bare rooms, shabby
clothes, and a perpetual assumption of bankruptcy.
One very popular man even achieved the result on six
hundred. This was a rare triumph of extravagance,
however, and a reasonable ambition would confine
itself to a complete ignorance as to all outgoings.
And this Kingston Darnley could never acquire. The
ghost of his father stirred in him, demanding a solid
recollection of every purchase. He bought the best,
bought it and lavished it freely. But he never could
rid himself of the knowledge that it was the best, and
thus a faint suspicion of ostentatiousness hovered over
all his entertainments, and the happy, slovenly wastefulness
with which his contemporaries ran into debt
for atrocious port or uneatable dinners could never be
reached by a man with his finical instinct for perfection.
This lack of carelessness, either as to quantity
of pounds spent or quality of things purchased, stigmatized
its owner for ever as an outsider&mdash;not to mention
the fact that he invariably paid money down for all
he bought. His wealth might as fairly have been
blamed for this vice, perhaps; nevertheless, a hatred
for debt was one of Kingston’s most inalienable
legacies from Darnley-on-Downe, and, had he not been<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
able to pay cash for the best, he would certainly have
remained content to buy the worst. And this, again,
was a suspicious trait in the eyes of his contemporaries,
who, though quite happy to buy the worst, always
made it their pride to run up bills for it that would
have been exorbitant had they been ordering the best.</p>

<p>These small hereditary feelings set James Darnley’s
son apart from his contemporaries, and it only required
the remains of middle-class prudishness to achieve his
isolation. Kingston found it impossible, in spite of
habit and effort, to acquire the easy personal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans-gêne</i>,
the tripping, untrammelled tongue of his contemporaries.
He did his best; listened genially,
accumulated anecdotes and retailed them among his
friends; but always heavily, never as to the manner
born. His friends held the free, frank language only
possible to the perfectly cleanly mind, naked and unashamed;
he, for his part, was always uneasy in his
nudity, and took his share in the talk with that consciousness
of impropriety that doubles impropriety.
The Dadd respectability still hampered its rebellious
descendant, and prevented him from ever entering into
perfect harmony with that world where decency is a
matter of conduct, not by any means of language. On
this point his aunt Minne-Adélaïde had certainly the
advantage. But the woman is proverbially more
adaptable than the man.</p>

<p>Still isolated, then, at home and abroad, Kingston
came down at last from Oxford at twenty-four, a
character untried, unformed, unground by any real
contact with the mills of life. An inordinate sensitiveness
to impressions, an excessive personal daintiness,
were the marks of his nature at that time, so far as a
friend could discern it. For the rest, very pleasant
of look and temper, friendly, honest, and no more
selfish than a good-looking young fellow of four-and-twenty<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
has every right to be. Lady Adela was delighted
to receive him under her wing once more, and
noticed with joy the subsidence of some of his more
tumultuous ideas into tranquillity. She had a fearful
notion that everyone left Oxford ‘a roaring atheist,’
and it was a great joy to her that Kingston completely
disproved this fallacy, not only by accompanying her
to church, but also by carrying her hymn-book. She
devoted herself to exploiting her son, and he, not finding
rebellion necessary for his pleasure, allowed himself
to be guided wherever his mother wished.</p>

<p>Rich and handsome in high degree, he began to find
London a very pleasant and companionable place,
without the ostentatious thoughtlessness of Oxford, or
the frank intellectual apathy of his home. In point of
fact, London began to do for him what neither home
nor Oxford had succeeded in doing. Gradually he
grew down to his own level, his edges were rubbed off,
his generous, exaggerated ideas dwindled to their
proper place in the perspective of life. He realized
that to live well and beautifully it is not necessary to
be for ever examining the foundations of action;
that life is simple and enjoyable for those who prefer
living it to discussing it; that justice, while august
and unattainable in the abstract, and astonishingly
contradictory in its precepts, is yet, in the concrete,
very easily discerned and followed in this workaday
sphere by plain-minded people whose eyes are fixed,
not on the stars in high heaven, but on their reflection
in the muddy ways of the world. He ceased to nourish
fantastic theories against the hanging of murderesses,
conceived the possibility of good in vivisection, and
began at last to contemplate a Piccadilly midnight
with the not unkindly stoicism of a man of the world.
Inwardly, as he often told himself, his ideas remained
the same, but their outward manifestation grew calmer<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
and more ordinary. When he met his Oxford friends
he found that he was much more in sympathy with
their way of taking life as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lady Adela was bent on seeing him safely
married. This, she considered, was the easiest and
most desirable way of protecting him against all the
wicked possibilities that lie in wait for a young man.
To save him from the contamination of many women
by tying him tight to one, before he had had time to
look about and make his choice, seemed to her a very
prudent, not to say holy, course. So she paraded
desirable damsels before him, and held amicable counsel
with mothers not at all averse from an alliance with
Kingston Darnley’s wealth. The mothers and Lady
Adela worked and manœuvred with Machiavellian
cunning; needless to say, their designs would have been
plain to a sucking child; and, equally needless to say,
Kingston, pleased and flattered, lent himself more or
less amiably to their strategy, with a guilelessness that
quite reassured them as to his ignorance of their
purposes.</p>

<p>But that very blamelessness of her son’s which Lady
Adela wished to safeguard was the ruin of her plan.
For, as a matter of fact, Lady Adela, by an accident of
fate, rather than by any perspicacity of intellect, was
right in holding the mother’s usual superstition of her
son’s purity. Kingston Darnley, emotional and fastidious
of temperament, impressionable rather than
passionate, curious and idealistic, had hitherto not
gone the way of all flesh. He had avoided ‘experiences’;
and experiences had never sought him out.
The sense of personal decency remained strong upon
him, and its strength was reinforced by his old theories
of morality, and by his strong tendency towards
mental, rather than physical passion. So he remained
a spectator in the great sexual battle of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>And this onlooker attitude is not endearing even to
the most holy and maidenly of women. Women require
to feel that a man is a man&mdash;that is, they require
to feel the thrill of his virility in the deep fibres of their
consciousness&mdash;to have their interest caught and held
by the proximity of the dominating male. It is only
to the depraved woman that the saint is of personal
interest; and, even then, her interest is depraved as
her nature. The normal girl&mdash;though she has not the
faintest understanding what her wishes mean&mdash;needs
to feel the possible conqueror in the man she is talking
to&mdash;at least, if he is to rouse her curiosity and grow
in her acquaintance. And this mysterious thrill, of
the man triumphant, Kingston was utterly unable
to communicate. Therefore his friendships with
women were almost wholly impersonal. He had none
of that love-making power which experiences confer;
had no idea of how the blood is stirred and defiance
stimulated; no gift for that bold expression of physical
approval which is so dear to even the best of women.
Women had to ask him if their frocks were pretty,
and if he liked their hats; even then his answers never
went the fervent lengths that their questions had been
meant to open up.</p>

<p>His flirtations were abstract, platonic, unearthly&mdash;all
that a mother considers most unprofitable, though
perilous. The artist, indeed, can be a sensualist;
but the artistic spirit and the sensual have no real
relationship. What attracts the one repels the other,
and it is only within the fierce energetic soul of genius
that the two can be reconciled. Kingston Darnley,
without genius, had the artist spirit. And the artist
spirit was for ever showing him fresh superficial
blemishes in the offered maidens&mdash;blemishes whose deterrent
force his animalism was not powerful enough
to overcome. This one had hands that didn’t match;<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
that one perpetually wore lace mittens; a third had a
nose that perspired at dances; or an irritating cackle
that revealed a golden tooth. One and all, he liked
them&mdash;even loved them&mdash;in so far as their minds were
clear, pleasant, friendly, lovable. But to be loved
for her mind is the last thing that a well-looking
young woman requires. And when he thought of
marrying them, when he considered the prospect of
living for ever with a perspiring nose or a mittened
hand, Kingston revolted at the idea, no matter how
precious the soul that owned the nose or the mitten.</p>

<p>It may be imagined, then, that, whatever his relations
with older, plainer women, settled in life, he
was neither popular nor at ease with the marriageable
maidens provided by his mother. In vague dissatisfaction
with his home, he was even anxious to marry
and settle down with some sympathetic, adorable
woman&mdash;but always that accursed prosaic aspect of
the case came uppermost, and repelled him in horror
from the plan.</p>

<p>Only once had he ever felt what he hoped might be
the premonitory thrill of a really great passion&mdash;a
passion such as might tide him over the more difficult
questions involved. In this hope he had nurtured
young love; and as love in so many lucky people is
a matter of habit and determination, he had seemed
soon to be in a fair way to success. The girl, too,
showed signs of approval, and everything appeared so
prosperous that Lady Adela gave hearty thanks and
put half a crown into the plate, feeling that Heaven had
earned more than its customary shilling. And then
one day he had sat with the girl and her aunt in
Kensington Gardens. And the cruel glare of daylight
had shown him a fine colony of down on her nose,
and the places whence and where her maid had transferred
a rosette to hide a stain on her gown. All was<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
over. The girl was everything delightful; but the
idea of being bound eternally to a potentially bearded
nose was impossible. Kingston could no longer bear
the thought of marrying, and told his mother that his
hope had proved fallacious. Heaven only got sixpence
the next Sunday; and, even so, it was in coppers.</p>

<p>It was shortly after this episode that Heaven, bearing
no malice, had thrown Lady Adela into the track of
Lady Agnes Mortimer. Lady Agnes was a single
woman of small means, and an eccentricity that passed
all bounds. However, she was something of a personage,
by virtue of her name as well as of her character,
and the great-niece whom she was trying to
marry might do very well for Kingston Darnley. So
thought Lady Adela, pondering the many eligible
qualities of the girl who would one day be daughter to
a Duke of March and Brakelond, and who, besides,
had so many qualities that endearingly resembled her
own&mdash;at least, so far as kindness, devotion, sweetness,
and piety went. She brought her son, accordingly,
into contact with Miss Mortimer, and was surreptitiously
overjoyed to find him obediently disposed.
As for Lady Agnes, she contemplated with equanimity
the introduction of the Darnley wealth into the impoverished
House of Mortimer, and tried to soften
down her asperities lest the match should be impeded.</p>

<p>The House of March and Brakelond no longer
loomed so large in the public eye as once it had, and as
Gundred still felt it should. The reigning Duke was
an imbecile, uncomfortably poor and very aged. There
was no Duchess, no near relations, nothing to give
prominence or interest even to the daughter of the
heir-apparent. Gundred Mortimer attracted little
notice in London, keeping house parsimoniously for
her father in Russell Square, and going out on the
rather shabby arm of Lady Agnes. Lady Agnes was<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
accepted because her eccentricities made her so incalculable
as to be amusing; but Gundred was soon
found to be almost depressingly normal and correct.
There were scores of more naturally noticeable girls in
London; Miss Mortimer, as Miss Mortimer, had no sort
of personal importance, whatever power and dignity
Fate might see fit to bestow at some later date on
‘Lady Gundred.’ Nicely mannered, nicely minded,
nicely dressed, Miss Mortimer was an inconspicuous,
if pleasant, figure in the crowd, and the elevation of
her father to the dukedom seemed so remote that there
was no according her any advance on her face-value.
Had the prospect of finding her mistress and deputy
Duchess at Brakelond only been more actual or
imminent, then the world might have lent Miss
Mortimer credit and respect on the reversion; but
Mr. Mortimer and his daughter had been Mr. and Miss
Mortimer for so many years now that no one found it
easy to think of them as prospective ‘Duke of March
and Brakelond’ and ‘Lady Gundred.’ Whenever
anyone thought now of the Mortimers, it was always
of the old&mdash;incredibly old&mdash;imbecile, dying eternally
at Brakelond among his parrots.</p>

<p>Nor was Mr. Mortimer himself of a commanding
character, fit to capture that popular interest which his
daughter’s quiet neatness had been unable to attach.
Mr. Mortimer, son of the late Lord Roger, and heir-apparent
to his uncle, must always, whatever his
position, have been a nonentity, not only from his
poverty, but from his silliness. Mr. Mortimer was
strangely, unbelievably silly. He was merely silly.
He was silly in the wrong way. He neither shocked
people nor amused them. Even his daughter realized
that he was silly, and felt no grievance with the world
for ignoring him. The world had, at one time, done its
best to encourage a coming Duke. But the long delay<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
in the succession, coupled with Mr. Mortimer’s overwhelming
foolishness, had gradually worn off the
patience of even the most far-sighted; and now his
daughter went about inconspicuously with her great-aunt,
while her father stayed unregretted at home,
and presumed on his prospects in a placid, most-comfortable-chair-assuming
way.</p>

<p>Gentle, neat, polite, Miss Mortimer, in her heart of
hearts, resented the indifference with which the world
seemed to treat the future mistress of Brakelond.
And this resentment, demure and calm as it was, did
not make her more attractive or approachable to the
men from whom she would have liked to claim attention
as her right. She stiffened herself into a rigid
piety, and by contrast with the gay, attractive girls
around her, made herself defiantly dull and godly in
demeanour, pluming herself the while on her unfaltering
maintenance of old-fashioned piety in degenerate
days. And as soon as the men discovered
that, in her way, she was mildly sulking at them for not
making more of her, they ceased their efforts to make
anything at all, and took refuge with the hundreds of
other bright, pleasant girls who had twice Miss Mortimer’s
charm and none of her prospects or pretensions.</p>

<p>It was strange that Gundred, delightfully pretty in
her cool way, serene, beautifully mannered, could
exert no compelling force on her surroundings. That
she wished to claim attention was the sign of her
weakness; for those who can command attention never
take the trouble of asking for it. But Gundred’s
mind was always secluded, self-centred, reserved. She
never gave out any light or warmth. She accepted,
absorbed, received with gracious dignity; she never
had the power of radiating any return of friendly
feeling, any comforting geniality of human sympathy.
As a talker she was gently frigid, sweetly insipid in her<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
way of avoiding all topics of general interest, and, while
restricting the conversation to her own concerns, of
restricting it entirely to such of those as were most
obvious and least interesting to the world at large.
The weather, as it affected her plans; the visits that she
paid, the churches she attended, and the cooks that
she engaged; such were the subjects on which she
pellucidly discoursed in the prettiest of voices, with
the most pleasant of smiles; to the unutterable
weariness of some partner who wanted a little more
vitality in the conversation.</p>

<p>Nor was she more successful as a listener. Even
during the most thrilling recitals her eye might be seen
wandering towards the next comer, or her mind guessed
to be wondering whether she had not accorded the
speaker enough of her attention. Men soon ceased to
tell her anything of value, and followed her own example
of talking amiably but saying nothing. Lady
Agnes was beginning to despair of her great-niece’s
prospects when Kingston Darnley was ushered into
the lists by his mother.</p>

<p>He came, he saw, he conquered. Idle-looking, tall
and fair, beautiful in build and feature, he could not but
command personal admiration; while in mind, keenly
active, riotously fanciful, he was the last man in the
world to conciliate Miss Mortimer’s approval, and,
therefore, the first to captivate her attention. To her
prim and maidenly habits of thought he was seductive
in his lazy twinkling moods, seductive in his moments
of emotion, seductive in those ebullitions of ridiculous
gaiety that Gundred knew to be so disorderly and unconventional,
yet reluctantly felt to be so delightful.
Hitherto men had either bored her or been bored by
her, had always failed to penetrate the closed garden of
her attention; Kingston Darnley now came swinging
carelessly into the sacred enclosure, and paid her the<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
compelling compliment of making her believe herself
brilliant and amusing.</p>

<p>Often it happens that the staid and decorous, hard
as iron in their disapproval of all frivolity, are suddenly
and completely melted by someone frivolous beyond
their uttermost possibilities of disapproval. One is
liable to love one’s opposites, if those opposites be
sufficiently opposed. Only a little less different herself,
and Gundred might have disliked Kingston
Darnley; but he was so madly divergent from all her
ideals that the very sharpness of the contrast drove her
to capitulate rapidly and completely. She even
ceased to claim his attention; she began to beg for it.</p>

<p>Her training had collaborated with her nature in
guarding her from self-betrayal. Her manners continued
gentle, guarded, suavely frigid as before.
But Lady Adela, with the eye of a hopeful mother,
pierced the disguise of Gundred’s feelings, and lost no
time in proclaiming the discovery to her son. Kingston
Darnley, for his part, was strongly attracted by Gundred.
To his fastidious temperament she never offered
a jarring note. She was always crisp and cool; always
deliberate and graceful; her hair was never disordered,
nor her hat crooked, nor her stockings ill-gartered.
At all points she was unalterably serene, impeccable
and satisfying. Emotionally, too, she gave him what
he wanted. He needed no ardent, unbalanced temper
in his wife. He needed just that gracious acquiescence
which Miss Mortimer supplied. She was restful
in all her ways, her mind was thoroughly well-mannered,
and her smiling calm assured him of a sympathetic
nature. As he laid his ideas before her he was enraptured
to see how sweetly, how reasonably she
listened, and found full agreement in her cool grey-blue
eyes, behind which, in reality, her inattentive brain
was admiring the tact of his tie. But, whatever her<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
secret thoughts, she never revealed them, and those
cool, grey-blue eyes had been trained to express
decorous attention; therefore Kingston Darnley soon
realized that in Miss Mortimer he had found that perfect
conjunction of ideal soul with ideal body in the
quest for which his five-and-twenty years had hitherto
been vainly spent.</p>

<p>That his feeling was not a great passion he sometimes
felt&mdash;that it was not even commensurate with the
passion which he had sometimes found himself forced
half-incredulously to divine behind the chill fires of
Gundred’s eyes. But his experience with the lady of
the downy nose had daunted him and disillusioned
him; with the knowledge of wide experience he now
knew that a great passion falls to the lot of very few,
and that it is well to take the good the gods provide.
Failing the Supramundane Mate to whom all idealists
look with longing, he would compromise with a woman
in every respect charming, alluring, delightful&mdash;a woman
of temperate mood, a woman of neat and faultless
style in body and mind, a woman, in short, who could
be trusted never to clash with any of life’s harmonies
or discords.</p>

<p>Her name, too, tragic and glorious, fired that curiosity
of man to possess something rare and old and
precious. Of Brakelond he only thought as a fit setting
for Gundred’s mystic charm. For Gundred’s serene
correctness, so prosaically pleasing in a London drawing-room,
became ‘mystic charm’ when associated in
the mind of her idealizing lover with the long oaken
galleries of Brakelond. And Gundred, for her part,
considered the possible glories of position and power
only as gifts to confer on her radiant, ridiculous
captor. She did what she decently could to please
and captivate Kingston, deployed cunning little unsuspected
wiles of dress and manner; brightened her<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
garments and her ways; achieved at last that miracle
only possible to a first-rate woman, of being gay without
becoming skittish. Little need had she of wiles.
Her gentle flawlessness satisfied Kingston Darnley
completely; and at his time of life, after his experience,
he knew enough to be humbly content with
satisfaction, asking no more of life, and expecting much
less. What folly to let a plump chicken escape from
the hand on the chance of a Phœnix flying out of the
bush at some far-distant date! Better give thanks
that the chicken is at least plump. Kingston Darnley
gave thanks accordingly, and dawdled along the happy
path that leads to proposal.</p>

<p>He could only see perfection everywhere. If Gundred
was sometimes unresponsive, that was surely her
cold and lovely maidenliness. If her acquiescent
sweetness lacked salt at times, and seemed to promise
biliousness, the criticism showed, in itself, a bilious
bachelor for whose ailment that sweetness had been
especially prescribed by Fate. If Gundred’s answers
sometimes seemed remote, inadequate, half-hearted,
that was but the effort of a loyal soul struggling to
get into perfect stride with his, and neglecting the
interests of the present for the sake of the future.
As he looked and listened, her unruffled pleasantness
destroyed for his emotions the grosser terrors of
marriage, and yet gifted them with a strange, appealing
fascination. Carried away by his approval, he proposed
at last, and was placidly accepted by a heart
resolutely dissembling its delight. Lady Adela heard
the news with joy, and a pound was not too much for
Heaven next Sunday.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>


<p>‘My dear,’ said Kingston Darnley to his mother one
afternoon, ‘being in love is the strangest thing.’</p>

<p>Long habit had taught him to indulge in soliloquy
under the mask of a dialogue with his mother. She
allowed him to talk, and never interrupted the flow
of his self-communings by any sudden sign of understanding
them. Few people are more comfortable to
confide in than those who can always be safely reckoned
on to understand nothing of what is said to them.
Lady Adela laid down her knitting and beamed
lovingly at her son over her spectacles.</p>

<p>‘A strange and blessed thing,’ she answered in her
soft tones.</p>

<p>‘I wonder,’ continued her son, ‘whether everybody
feels alike. More or less, I suppose&mdash;although everyone
thinks that he has the secret all to himself.’</p>

<p>‘Love is sent, sooner or later, to everyone,’ replied
Lady Adela.</p>

<p>‘But how do people know that it is the right love?’
questioned Kingston. Then he went on, without
waiting for the irrelevant answer which his mother
would surely provide. ‘Uncertainty is a deadly
thing. And the worst of it is that everyone who really
wants to find happiness must always be uncertain as
to the way. Only those who don’t care can ever be
perfectly, securely certain.’</p>

<p>‘True love is always unmistakable,’ replied his
mother, who, in her time, had married the late James
Dadd from a feeling that anything would be preferable
to prolonged existence with Lady Kirk-Hammerton.</p>

<p>‘Yes; but it must have different manifestations.
I remember when Tom Clifford was engaged to that<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
Menzies girl he couldn’t bear her out of his sight, never
let any other man have half a dozen words with her.
Now, I don’t mind who Gundred talks to, or what she
says&mdash;not a scrap. And&mdash;well, it’s always a joy to
see her, of course&mdash;everyone must feel that&mdash;but I
haven’t any wish to go about all day at the end of her
hat-ribbon. Is that because I am cold-blooded, or is
it the proper normal thing to feel?’</p>

<p>‘My dear boy is so full of chivalry,’ answered Lady
Adela with affectionate vagueness. ‘No nice girl would
like to be too much monopolized. It is hardly delicate.’</p>

<p>‘One had a sort of notion,’ continued Kingston,
unregarding, ‘that love-making was more of a desperate
flesh-and-blood affair. I suppose the real thing is
more ethereal than the everlasting philanderings that
one reads about. Heaven knows, they are earthly
enough.’</p>

<p>‘Marriages are made in heaven,’ replied his mother
reverentially.</p>

<p>‘And love is made on earth, I gather&mdash;at least, love
of the novelist’s sort. Certainly marriage is happier
in every way&mdash;calmer, less discomposing, more orderly
and decent and&mdash;and&mdash;abstract, as it were. I cannot
imagine anyone not loving Gundred. She appeals
to everything that is best in one. And the crowning
mercy of it all is that she never gives one thrills of any
kind, never rouses any primitive, prosaic emotions.
She is always just what one expects&mdash;gentle and
charming and satisfactory&mdash;and nothing else. There
is no intoxication about her. And, really, you know,
that is a relief. One had imagined that love&mdash;love
in the completest sense&mdash;was a kind of celestial
drunkenness. It is a tremendous relief to find that it
is only a quiet temperance drink after all&mdash;the Water of
Life, as it were. I don’t think either my head or my
stomach care very much for intoxicants.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>‘Your dear father was just the same,’ replied Lady
Adela calmly; ‘two glasses of port never failed to
upset him. Some people’s interiors are so sensitive.
If one is in the least troubled that way, it is far better
never to touch stimulants. Or peppermint, they say,
does wonders.’</p>

<p>‘One has wrestled through loves of different kinds,’
said Kingston, securely continuing his soliloquy, ‘and
it is certainly a blessed surprise to find that the real
thing is placid and satisfying. The hunger and thirst
of passion are fierce and dreadful&mdash;it never seemed
likely that perfect happiness could be found in the mere
appeasing of them. I am sure I much prefer the
lasting, tranquil completeness of an emotion to the
feverish clamour of an appetite. And that, after all,
is what most people seem to mean by love. I have
always rather hated violence and brutal manifestations.
They seem a little vulgar, very crude and indecent,
very unworthy of our higher emotional powers.’</p>

<p>‘My boy is so full of nice feeling,’ said Lady Adela;
‘violence is a terrible thing. I remember I once saw
a dog run over by a tram. I have never forgotten it.’</p>

<p>‘One feels a certain something solid and eternal
about real love,’ went on her son, contentedly talking
to himself aloud under pretence of addressing his
mother. ‘It is a huge level tract of feeling, stretching
out into the immensities, without anything to break
the enormous flat surface of it. It goes on for ever and
ever, without valleys or pinnacles, or rough places of
any kind. And surely that is better than perpetually
scrambling up peaks and falling off them again, into
abysses. Real love is not a mountain track; it is a
solid turnpike road with a smooth, sound surface.
One’s life jogs along it imperceptibly, and one’s attention
need not be kept fixed on the driving to see where
one is going. With Gundred I feel that I am with<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
someone whom I have known for ages in the past, and
whom I shall continue to know for ages in the future,
without jars or disconnections. There is something
monumental, something filling about the sensation.
People who find the hot rough-and-tumble pandemian
love enough for them would think the real
heavenly feeling stodgy and perhaps&mdash;well, perhaps
even a little dull. It does lack diversity somehow.
It offers repletion without any sauces to appetise. But,
then, I suppose the immensities must of necessity
seem monotonous to our small, jigging intelligences.’</p>

<p>‘I am sure, Kingston,’ said Lady Adela with conviction,
‘that no one could have a better intelligence
than you. It is quite something to be thankful for.’</p>

<p>‘Now, Gundred, for instance&mdash;very often with her
I have a shut-out feeling of getting no further, of
finding locked doors and stone walls. Sometimes I
have nothing that I want to say to her, and sometimes
she has nothing that she wants to say to me. Sometimes
she does not understand what I mean, sometimes
we seem to be talking different languages, without any
real wish to make ourselves intelligible. When we
have said that we love each other there is nothing
much left for us to say. And isn’t that exactly as it
should be? The love is the only thing that matters,
after all. One does not marry for the conversation,
but for the love. Other people can give one the conversation.
No; one has to look forward over the whole
field of life&mdash;it is not only the present amusement that
matters. What is very amusing and delightful for
half an hour would be quite intolerable to put up with
for fifty years of marriage life. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marrons glacés</i> and
caviare sandwiches are excellent in their way, but,
when everything is said and done, bread is the real
staple of existence. The primitive passionate lover is
trying to make half an hour’s surfeit of sweets and<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
savouries supply the place of all healthy meals through
all the years to come; it is only the idealist who sets
himself calmly down to a long indefinite course of
bread-and-butter. There can be no doubt that the
bread-and-butter regime is the saner and the more
blessed and the more refined of the two. But, of
course, if one simply lives from hand to mouth and
from hour to hour, the bread-and-butter scheme <em>is</em>
apt to look a little dull by comparison with frequent
snacks of indigestible, exciting dainties. However,
thank Heaven, I have got what is best for me&mdash;and
sense enough to recognise the fact. If Gundred sometimes
fails to feed me up with pretty fancies from hour
to hour, she is laying up for me a supply of satisfying
bread-and-butter for the rest of our lives. And one’s
whole life is obviously more important than any given
half-hour of it.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied Lady Adela after a pause, ‘but one
must be careful about bread-and-butter. Too much is
apt to make one stout. I quite agree with dear Gundred,
though, as to plain food being the most satisfactory
in the long run. I read the other day a very
nice book, in which the characters sat down to “a
plain but perfectly-cooked meal.” Now, that struck
me as expressing so exactly what one wants.’</p>

<p>‘My dear,’ said her son abruptly, ‘what did my
father and you talk about when you were engaged?’</p>

<p>Lady Adela, who had expected from her son the
soothing accompaniment of another monologue to the
music of her knitting, started at his abrupt question,
lost count of her stitches, then looked vaguely up at
last, her lips moving in a vain effort to recover her place
in the row.</p>

<p>‘What did we talk about?’ she repeated. Then she
blushed faintly. The distant past was transfigured
with romance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>‘Dear boy,’ she resumed in hushed, reverent tones.
‘The engagement is the sweetest time in a woman’s
life. The loveliest things your poor dear father gave
me. We were at Naples, you know, and one gets the
most charming corals there, and mosaics, and brooches
carved out of lava. I have got them all. And then
your poor dear father and I used to go out on to the
terrace in the evening and look at the sunset and
Vesuvius, and the steamers coming into the bay. He
used to take my hand, and we stood there, saying
nothing. There was nothing to say, dear. We both
felt too much. One does not want to talk. And sometimes
he&mdash;he would give me a kiss. And all the time&mdash;well,
there was nothing else in the world, somehow,
but just ourselves. We were quite alone. We should
have been quite alone, even in a crowd.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that is just exactly different with Gundred and
me. We are never alone. We should not be alone in
the wilderness. Gundred seems to live her life before
an invisible audience of hundreds of people. That is
why one can never get near her real self; there is
always the consciousness of the audience restraining
her.’</p>

<p>Lady Adela, however, was lost in roseate reminiscence.</p>

<p>‘So well I remember,’ she went on, ‘how the
evening used to get darker and darker as we stood on
the terrace, and the smell of dinner used to float up to
us so deliciously from the ground-floor. Your poor
dear father adored the Neapolitan cookery, and we
used to talk of how we would have someone who could
do <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">risotto</i> when we were married and settled down.
But none of our cooks ever could. Dear me, and the
lights in the bay, and the warm, quiet darkness of it
all, and just us two, alone in the world.’</p>

<p>The sweet and innocent sentimentality of Lady<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
Adela had succeeded in draping the usual beautiful
gauze of romance across an episode which, in its time,
had been marked by plain and practical precision.
As ivy, in the course of years, grows over the bare stone
of a ruin, so does romance cover over the hard bare
facts of a woman’s past. No matter how stark and
cold it may have been, yet, if her nature be loving and
soft, its softness will subdue and transfigure the
roughnesses of many crude bygone days. By this time
Lady Adela believed in her romantic marriage as firmly
as she believed in her vicar and her Sovereign.</p>

<p>‘So delightful it was to be with your poor dear
father,’ she went on; ‘he was the kindest and most
thoughtful of men. He always saw that I had a footstool
and a corner seat, and the sun nicely shaded off
my eyes. He used to come and sit by me, too, while
I was sketching, and read aloud to me until we both
fell asleep. I have never liked any one else to read
aloud to me since. Mamma was very bustling and
worldly, and I was not at all happy with her. But
when your poor dear father came and found me, the
whole of my life was changed. He was the fairy prince
that came to rescue me.’</p>

<p>‘But you told me once, my dear, that my father
had once cared very much for someone else.’</p>

<p>‘The world, dear boy, abounds in the most dreadful
women. And, indeed, why God made so many women
at all&mdash;and most of them so plain&mdash;nobody has ever
yet been able to tell me. There was a horrid creature
who made your poor dear father think he was in love
with her, as they call it. But, of course, he was nothing
of the kind. For as soon as she was safely drowned
and out of the way, he forgot all about her, and came
and married me, and no two people were ever happier
together in the world than he and I. Ours was a case
of true love, dear boy, if ever there was one. And<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
I am certain yours will be the same. It is my earnest
prayer, dear, and my sure hope. Gundred is the most
thoroughly nice, good girl.’</p>

<p>‘And it would not matter if a shade of dullness
sometimes seemed to fall between us?’</p>

<p>By this time Lady Adela was, for a wonder, awake
to the purport of her son’s questionings. Her excursion
into the past had brought her back refreshed into
the present.</p>

<p>‘Kingston, dear,’ she answered, ‘what else would
you expect from a really nice-minded girl? She is
not a married woman yet. The time has not yet
come for her to enter fully into your life, or you into
hers. Remember how your poor dear father and I
used to sit silent together for hours, never saying a
word.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but you did not feel the want of words. I
think we sometimes almost do. That makes all the
difference.’</p>

<p>‘Words will come, dear&mdash;words and all other
blessings in their time. Gundred will be the greatest
help and comfort to you in your life, and I am sure you
love each other tenderly.’</p>

<p>Kingston suddenly began to feel the difficulties of
the dialogue. To confide is all very well and comfortable,
so long as the confidant is not listening or understanding.
The moment he shows signs of noticing
what is said, the mortifying indelicacy of the proceeding
becomes plain. Finding his mother unwontedly
awake to his remarks, Kingston’s sensitiveness drew
in its horns.</p>

<p>‘Oh, thanks, my dear,’ he said lightly. ‘I am sure
everything will turn out for the best. I am the
luckiest fellow alive, and don’t suppose I forget it.’</p>

<p>‘Some people always touch wood,’ said Lady Adela
meditatively, ‘when they say a thing like that. Such<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
a silly superstition. But, still, there may be something
in it.’ She rapped the tea-table firmly.</p>

<p>Mother and son had been so absorbed in their
dialogue that they had not heard the hall door bell
ring. Suddenly the door opened, and Miss Mortimer
was announced. Fresh, crisp, pleasant as ever,
Gundred entered the room and kissed her future
mother-in-law.</p>

<p>‘Dear Lady Adela,’ she said, ‘I felt I must come
round and see how you were. This heat&mdash;so ridiculously
trying for a climate like ours.’ Then she turned
to Kingston. ‘And Kingston,’ she added; ‘how
is he?’</p>

<p>‘Poor gentleman,’ replied her lover tragically. ‘Mr.
Darnley has been quite on his last legs lately. But
he recovered miraculously all of a sudden, as soon as
he saw Mapleton showing somebody into the room.’</p>

<p>‘You really do talk the most shocking rubbish,’ said
Gundred sensibly, but without disapproving sternness.
‘Lady Adela, why do you let Kingston talk such
rubbish?’</p>

<p>‘My mother,’ replied Kingston, intercepting the
mild remonstrance of Lady Adela’s reply, ‘brought me
up to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth. You asked me about the state of my
feelings, and I gave you a truthful reply. Behold!
Your coming has taught me, for the ninety-ninth time,
that life is worth living. Sit down and I will ring for
tea. My dear, surely it is tea-time? Gundred has
clearly come here simply and solely to get a cup of
tea. With me she will have nothing to say. It is
tea she wants. She pants for it, like the hart for cooling
brooks.’</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ said Gundred; ‘don’t talk like that. It’s
irreverent. But, indeed, Lady Adela, I certainly
should be delighted if you would let me stay and have<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
some tea with you. I lunched with Aunt Agnes, and
she gave me a lunch of unimaginable nastiness, so
that now I feel as if I had not eaten for days.’</p>

<p>‘You poor darling!’ cried Lady Adela with pitying
indignation; ‘that is always the way. Wait, and I
will order you something really nice. Look after
Gundred, Kingston dear, while I go and interview
Tessington about to-night. I have been wanting to
see her all the afternoon, and I can just as well have
her up to the dining-room.’</p>

<p>Having thus tactfully explained her departure, Lady
Adela left the lovers alone. A silence fell.</p>

<p>‘What are you thinking of?’ asked Gundred at last.</p>

<p>‘I am wondering,’ replied Kingston, ‘what, precisely,
is going on behind those inscrutable eyes of yours&mdash;what
thoughts are playing about behind that cool
white forehead of yours. And the worst of it is that
I can never find out. You will never let me in of your
own accord; and if I took an axe and forced my way
in I should only find a mess of blood and bone.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be horrid,’ said Gundred, shuddering. ‘I
am sure I tell you everything I think. I hide nothing
from you.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not, you well-mannered Sphinx. But you
reveal nothing. Nothing about you gives any index
to your thoughts. You are too fearfully and wonderfully
trained. I have seen you suffering agonies of
boredom with a smile; I have seen you suffering
torments of cold and discomfort with the sweetest
blandness. No one can ever guess what a person like
that is really thinking. For all I know, you may, at
this very moment, be remarking a smut on my nose or
a blemish on my character. Your behaviour gives no
clue.’</p>

<p>‘But, Kingston dear,’ protested Gundred, moved
by this denunciation, ‘you would not have a rude<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
and boorish wife, I am sure. And you know I have no
fault to find with you. I think I have shown that&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘With really rude people one knows where one is.
Their amiability means true friendship and true approval.
With your suave, elegant, charming sort
smiles may mean anything or nothing. One never
knows where one is. “Mind you come again soon,”
you tell me, ever so pleasantly. And the very instant
before you have said exactly the same thing, in the
same cordial inflection, with the same inviting smile,
to some woman whom I know you intensely dislike,
and only allow inside the house on sufferance. Now,
what am I to think?’</p>

<p>Gundred began to feel quite distressed.</p>

<p>‘But, Kingston,’ she cried, ‘one must be civil. One
simply must. Why do you attack me like this?
What have I done?’</p>

<p>‘You are such a beautiful little icicle,’ answered her
lover. ‘Will you never thaw? You are an icicle
inside an iron safe. How can one get at you to thaw
you?’</p>

<p>‘How utterly absurd you are, Kingston! Haven’t
I given you the key? Besides&mdash;oh, I’m not an icicle;
I’m not a bit of an icicle. Only&mdash;well, what is it you
want?’</p>

<p>‘Be quite, quite honest for a minute, Gundred.
Strip your soul stark, and tell me whether you love me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t hold my hands like that. It’s so hot....’</p>

<p>‘You are always cool, my dear&mdash;a capital refrigerator
you are.’</p>

<p>‘Kingston, you are unkind this afternoon.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what about my answer? Do you really love
me, Gundred?’</p>

<p>Gundred still shirked the inquisition, though secretly
she enjoyed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>‘I am engaged to you,’ she answered.</p>

<p>‘That is the muffled up, overdressed sort of thing
you always say,’ replied Kingston. ‘Give me the bare,
naked truth. Do you truly love me, Gundred?’</p>

<p>She turned upon him with a flash of inspiration.</p>

<p>‘You would never ask me such a question if you
weren’t sure of your answer already,’ she cried.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not, but give it me all the same. It’s not
enough to know a thing; one wants to be told it sometimes.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that is just like a silly woman&mdash;never believing
a man cares for her unless he goes on telling her so
twice a minute. Oh, Kingston, don’t let us be so
childish. These things don’t need to be talked about.
I hate talking about them. It isn’t decent. The more
one feels the less one should say. Only kitchen-maids
chatter about their love affairs, and wear their hearts
on their sleeves.’</p>

<p>‘Anyhow, that’s better than wearing it in someone
else’s pocket, as so many others do.... Gundred,
does your soul never take off its stays? Does it always
live in public, on view, in full Court dress and train and
feathers?’</p>

<p>‘Kingston&mdash;dear Kingston, I think you must be
a little bilious. I am not always in public. Here I
am alone with you&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘Alone? Oh dear, no! You are always acting,
always posing to half a hundred people in the room
whom I can’t see. They prevent you from ever
speaking honestly to me, as I speak to you. They dictate
the way you walk, the chair you sit in, every word
and action of your day.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t understand you, Kingston. A woman has
so much more to think of than a man in some ways.
Surely ... you know by now that I&mdash;well, that I do
care for you. You mustn’t ask me to be always<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
saying so. You wouldn’t like it if I did. Do be
reasonable. One has to behave decently&mdash;yes? Our
points of view are so different. It seems to me that
I tell you far too much&mdash;sometimes I think I am
shameless and horrid&mdash;and yet you&mdash;you think me
cold and unsatisfactory.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t you realize how a man starves for a little
warmth, Gundred?’</p>

<p>‘I hate to think of men like that; I am sure you are
not one of them. Anyhow, I hope we shall never condescend
to their horrid level. You are engaged to
me, Kingston, and that ought to be quite enough....
It is for me.’</p>

<p>She glanced at him with gleaming eyes. He heard
the cool, level tone, and missed the gleam. He sighed.</p>

<p>‘And some people have thought <em>me</em> cold and fish-blooded,’
he thought, in a spasm of irritation. But
clearly it was useless to dash himself against the firm
rock of Gundred’s placidity.</p>

<p>‘You are almost as impersonal as one of those
Buddhist saints that my Uncle Robert has lived with,’
he replied. ‘You make one feel cold.’</p>

<p>Gundred, resolved in her attitude, would take no
notice of his renewed attack. ‘Your Uncle Robert,’
she said, ‘have I heard of him? Oh yes; he is that
brother of your father’s who ran away to Japan so
many years ago and became a Buddhist himself,
poor man, didn’t he? Will he ever come back to
England?’</p>

<p>‘Not if he’s as wise as he sounds. His life out there
seems to be almost perfect contentment.’</p>

<p>‘How strange that is&mdash;yes? Well, I have got odd
relations, too, in out-of-the-way corners of the world,
you know. There’s poor papa’s sister, Isabel Darrell,
away in Australia, with a daughter. I really rather
hope they will never come home. Colonial relations<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
are apt to be so truly dreadful. And now, Kingston
dear, what I came to see you about to-day is this.
Have you any very strong ideas as to the honeymoon?
Because papa and Uncle Henry and Aunt Agnes are
all very anxious that we should go to Brakelond.
And I do think there is something rather nice in the
idea. After all, I suppose it will be our place some
day, and our children’s after us. In a way it is my
wedding-present to you. Don’t you think we might
begin our married life there? Uncle Henry won’t be
in our way at all. He is kept in a wing right apart
from the rest of the Castle, and the building is so
enormous that you might put up twenty people there,
and no one need have any notion that there was anyone
in the place besides himself.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied Kingston, warming to the prospect;
‘it sounds a delightful plan. I was wondering when
we could go to Brakelond. Hugh Frazer did say something
about lending us his place, but I can easily explain.
Luckily, all my Dadd relations are out of the
reckoning, so there is no one to claim any tiresome
rights. By all means let us go to Brakelond. It
must be the most gorgeous old place. Haven’t they
still got the room where Queen Isabel sat and worked?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, horrid woman!’ said Gundred tersely. ‘I
don’t like to talk about her. I can scarcely believe she
was my ancestress.’</p>

<p>‘But splendid, Gundred&mdash;splendid and tragic and
romantic.’</p>

<p>Gundred’s firm, pale lips tightened into a line of
disapproval.</p>

<p>‘I never can see why wicked people are especially
splendid or tragic or romantic,’ she said. ‘Goodness
is so much nicer&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps it is,’ replied Kingston, after a pause, ‘but
not always so interesting.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>‘One has no wish to be interested in anything that
is not pure and beautiful and good,’ announced Gundred,
with an air of virtuous finality.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, we’ll go there, anyhow,’ answered Kingston,
shying away from the imminent argument, ‘and
have no end of a mystic splendid time. We’ll sit
about all day, and forget the world, and read novels to
each other.’</p>

<p>‘Not novels, dear,’ said Gundred gently; ‘sensible
books&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Kingston shrugged his shoulders. Clearly the conversation
had run into one of its frequent culs-de-sac,
and there was no continuing it. Gundred was impregnable
to all assaults of the picturesque, and
adamant to all new opinions or suggestions. Over
Kingston was coming that bruised and daunted feeling
to which, sooner or later, his meetings with her seemed
invariably to lead. She held him at arm’s length,
baffled him, rebuffed him, deliberately kept herself a
stranger from his ardours, his intimacy. Each dialogue
of theirs seemed to resolve itself inevitably into
a futile if friendly discussion of topics indifferent. Of
course this offered all the richer promise for the long
years of coming matrimony, but meanwhile Gundred’s
maidenly reserve turned the preliminary canter of
courtship into a jog over rather arid and sterile ground.
When Lady Adela tardily returned to the room, in
the wake of tea, she found the lovers canvassing the
<em>Academy</em>. Gundred, however, was so perfectly certain
that her choice was sound and holy that the
conversation was unfruitful if amiable. Lady Adela
joined it, and it easily admitted a third voice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>


<p>Brakelond had the impassive mouldering grandeur
of a great house that has outlived the troubled hours
of its glory, and settled into a lethargic contemplation
of its past. From very far away its castellated mass
could be seen dominating the country from the steep
wooded hill on which it perched. On three sides
the forest flowed down in ample splendid folds, a
cloak of emerald in spring, and, in autumn, cloth of
gold. And along the fourth side the crag dropped
away sheer into the western sea. Seen from afar, the
Castle on its pinnacle had a remote and fairy-like
effect, as if, indeed, the scene had been of Camelot or
Broceliaunde. Into the clear blue of the sky pricked
the soft sapphire masses of the Castle, the looming
great Drum Tower, and the smaller, indistinguishable
turrets; while, below, fell smooth and swift the dim
violet of the woodland, like a misty drapery of colour.
Over the country ran other lesser ranges, clothed in
younger, neater woodlands; but the great building on
its eminence ruled supreme, and the forest round the
skirts of its hill was the very fairy-haunted forest of
old romance. Among those gnarled trunks, in those
green eternal twilights of the thicket, might Merlin
still lie sleeping, or King Mark, a-hunting, yet hap on
Tristram of Lyonesse. And far overhead, the crown
of the country, rose the mystic walls of a Castle that
might have held the fair Iseult or Morgan the Sorceress,
a great drowsy splendour of stone, willingly cut off
from the rush and turmoil of to-day, dreaming for
ever, in complacent calm, of that hot and glorious life
that it had long ceased to live.</p>

<p>As an old illustrious man or woman carries always
the consciousness and the glamour of his achievement,<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
no matter into what feebleness or decrepitude old age
may have brought him, so buildings that are not of
yesterday carry always the haunting sense of their
past, and achieve a tranquil pride in desolation and
the world’s oblivion, for ever beyond the reach of any
smug, inglorious new country-house, all red-brick and
sham Elizabethan gables.</p>

<p>The country-house has telephones and electric light
and all the latest devices of luxury; the old castle has
matted corridors and inadequate lamps, and a general
air of shabbiness. But that shabbiness is more beautiful
and well-bred than all the clamorous elegancies of
the other; the comparison is between some old and
splendid lady, poor, dowdy, and forgotten in the
clacking crowd of tongues, but serene in her impregnable
charm, the incarnation of all that is finest in the
traditions of a thousand years&mdash;and some scented,
powdered woman of to-day, frilled, curled, decorated
with all the lavish and assertive ornaments by which
novelty seeks uneasily to impose its fancied supremacy
over antiquity&mdash;a woman of loud tones, loud colours,
loud movements, in her own person a great braying
band of jingles from the latest edition of that comic
opera which is such a creature’s London life.</p>

<p>Only the self-sufficient&mdash;in fact, only those who are
perfectly calm and indifferent to the general suffrage,
secure in their unalterable, unselfconscious certainty
of breeding&mdash;can afford to ignore the tricks and
trappings on which the less fortunate have to rely for
notice. Only the well-bred can afford to be dowdy;
only the well-bred can afford to ignore the Peau
d’Espagne or the Violette des Bois which may happen
to be in fashion, and trust for their triumph only to
the faint, unanalyzed fragrance of beauty and nobility
that accompanies them inseparably from birth to
death, without effort or expense of theirs. And as<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
a modern building, decked out in modern old oak,
and fussy with stolen ornaments from bygone times,
must always base its claim to admiration on the self-advertisement
of its luxuries, so some old collapsing
turret, the haunt of dead Queens, the chosen home of
sad beautiful memories, needs no adornment, no
advertisement to reinforce its calm and unconscious
right to our worship. Brakelond, old, gorgeous, forgotten
Brakelond, was too proud to trick itself out for
popular applause, too quiet in its self-centred pride to
allure the vulgar; it challenged reverence by right
divine, and held the attention without desire to do so.</p>

<p>All this of Brakelond far away, throned on the undulating
horizon of misty woodland. It was a sapphire
crown on a pinnacle of the world’s rim. It did not
flop and flounder along its hill, like Windsor; rather,
it held itself bravely, concisely, on its seat, with something
of Belvoir’s distant majesty. But Belvoir is as
generous as it is beautiful, offering itself to the world’s
admiration; Brakelond, on the contrary, was governed
by a grimly selfish passion of seclusion, severe and
rigid. It kept aloof as if it had indeed been some
magic Castle of Lyonesse, and none was permitted to
approach beyond the outermost borders of the forest
precincts. Lonely, menacing, fearful, Brakelond
frowned away the approach of all new-comers. The
spirit of its owner haunted it, insisted on inviolable
privacy.</p>

<p>For, from the great dominating Drum Tower flew
perpetually the flag that told of an old man, brainless,
dribbling, dreadful, dying for ever by slow inches in
his high, drug-scented rooms. Around him ceaselessly
screeched the parrots whose bright colours were the
one consciousness of his life, whose poignant yellings
made the one music capable of penetrating to his ears.
Their clamour drove his attendants frantic, but the<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
old Duke, immobile, log-like, gave no sign of discomfort,
gave no sign at all of life or its energies. He
seemed dead, had seemed dead for many years; his
existence tottered on a breathless poise that a hair’s
touch might send swinging over the border-line of
death; but that poise was firm and even; nothing
shook it; nothing, in the cool unbroken lethargy of
his days, could agitate the balance that rested so
unwaveringly on such a razor’s edge of insecurity.
So the parrots daily rent heaven with their screams,
and amid the infernal din the aged wizard of the fairy
castle, shut away from all the world by a barrier of
stout walls and locked gates and impassable centuries,
lay and awaited his end, a creature long since wiped
out of life, having no part in to-day or to-morrow, but
already one with the innumerable yesterdays of the
dead.</p>

<p>Into this haunt of sad mystery did Gundred bring
her husband for their honeymoon. So stern and
tragic a setting for the bright, modern drama of their
lives had something stimulating about the abruptness
of its contrast. Happiness, after all, could build
beneath the eaves of that immemorial tragedy, and
the flower of joy spring gaily from the crevices of that
citadel whose mortar was tears and blood and the
bones of innumerable generations, crushed and
mangled. Kingston and Gundred took their pleasure
lightly amid the surrounding atmosphere, and, in the
labyrinthine vastness of the building soon lost all
consciousness of that secluded presence, high up in
the remote wing where the parrots made their song
in the undiscerning ears of the dead that could not die.</p>

<p>The main bulk of the Castle was old&mdash;some of it
very old. On one projecting spur of rock that overhung
the sea a hundred feet and more below, stood the
most ancient relic of all&mdash;a suite of little wooden-panelled<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
rooms, low, many-cornered, slippery-floored,
with strange turns and steps between them. This
wing was cut off from the rest of the Castle, which
towered over it from behind like a crouched monster.
It was connected only by one small corridor, and held
a rough primeval chapel which dated from days before
any other stone of Brakelond, and was given by tradition
as a place of assignation between Tristram and
Iseult. This fragment of myth made visible seemed
to be no part of the building, but a precious jewel of
the past extruded from its enormous fabric.</p>

<p>The body of the building, too, contained ancient,
history-haunted corners. A series of rooms was
credited to the design and the occupation of Queen
Isabel. Here the She-Wolf of France, old Queen
Jezebel, had dwelt with the lover whom she nearly
seated on the throne of England. A traditional portrait
of her still gazed out across the rooms she had
owned, a stiff daub on a wooden panel, giving the fierce,
tight-lipped stare of the adventuress, high-boned, pink-cheeked,
archaic in drawing, angular, convincing in
its very primitiveness of workmanship&mdash;jewelled and
furred there and here in dimmed patches of colour
that had once been crudely brilliant. Brakelond had
been the scene of Queen Isabel’s highest fortunes.
Her ghost still seemed to hold the high halls of her
prosperity, her pitiless spirit dominated that wing
which owed its life to her. This was her true burial-place&mdash;rather
than Castle Rising, where at last, after
all the changes of her eventful life, she died, old, fat,
monstrous, honoured in dishonour, incredibly wealthy,
the first millionaire of Europe.</p>

<p>Dark and dusty were the windings of the Castle
corridors&mdash;dark and dusty as the winding paths of
Mortimer and Isabel. The building had been put
together from time to time, added to, built on to, with<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
no thought of conformity, of harmony, of convenience.
It was rather a congeries of Castles than one unanimous
edifice. From far off it was seen as a single fabric;
within its walls the daunted visitor could gain comfort
from noticing its many discordancies, the innumerable
violent breaks in the continuity of its development.
There was no complete rhythm in the building’s design;
part clashed with part, and in the jarring conflict of
tastes and periods the enchantment which distance had
lent was shattered by the sudden onslaughts of criticism.
Here jutted out a Georgian wing, solid and
stiff, but ill-attuned to the austere majesty of the great
Drum Tower. There, a Duke of the eighteenth century,
a friend of Pope and Lady Mary, had erected a
Chinese pagoda, that perked impertinently up with
its fantastic, saucy eaves among the stalwart turrets
that had frowned on Edward of York, and given vain
shelter to Marguerite of Anjou. Then, again, another
Duke, contemporary of George the Glorious, had
appended to the Elizabethan front of the Castle a
small but accurate copy of the Brighton Pavilion. Its
wriggling cupolas, its fluted minarets, shone white
with plaster, and its main plantation of bulbs, like
gigantic onions, bulged and swelled beneath an oriel
whence the Virgin Queen had watched a masque.</p>

<p>Each inhabited portion of the Castle, too, was of
a style violently and even deliberately discordant with
the severe and uninhabitable splendours of the Drum
Tower and the old Keep. These contained huge,
gloomy rooms, with infinitesimal windows, that looked
out, for the most part, on sunless little courtyards,
mere wells of darkness, made by the addition of new
buildings to the old. Here, in these big, stark halls,
were mouldering arrangements of armour, or acres of
dingy pictures, bloated Flemish boors, dubious angular
Madonnas, riotous female nudities, all hidden from the<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
world by a merciful veil of dirt. The stone floors were
inadequately disguised with worn matting, and at
night one feeble, smoky lamp was allotted for the
illumination of each apartment. A proud neglect, an
almost arrogant ostentation of poverty and discomfort,
reigned supreme.</p>

<p>The inhabited wings of the Castle were different in
effect, though similar in scheme. Rows of bare
barrack-like rooms lined the corridors&mdash;hung with
glaring chintzes, and furnished with chairs of rep and
horsehair. Their ornaments were meagre as their
blankets, and their large windows threw a merciless
glare of daylight on their serviceable sterling ugliness.
Each had a square of carpet from which the pattern
had long been trodden out and through in patches;
each had cupboards and washstand of light grained
wood; each was coldly spacious, airy, cheerless, and
inhospitable. Most loud of all the discords that many
generations of bad architects had contributed to the
original of Queen Isabel’s castle was the high white
wing where the old Duke lay dying. An Early Victorian
Duchess had made this addition; it was big and
bald and bare, faced with white stucco and adorned
with modern-Gothic pinnacles. It grew out like a
monstrous polyp from the side of a gracious little
Jacobean pavilion, and dominated the main entrance
with its stalwart blatancy. To crown all, the same
Duchess had built on to the great Drum Tower a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</i> on the model of the Erechtheion, and
had holystoned the Drum Tower itself of a pale and
repellent buttermilk blue.</p>

<p>Of all this accumulated history Gundred was, as it
were, the sum and incarnation. The Castle, village
of unconnected houses though it was in reality, yet had
a collective personality of its own, even as a crowd of
unrelated human beings has a collective personality<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
beyond and above that of a mere aggregation of units.
And she, its daughter and heiress, was also its result.
It is written that neither man nor woman can ever
escape from his or her traditions. The traditions are
the character, and we are the reincarnated spirits of
very many dead ages. As sunlight brings out all
manner of unguessed possibilities from the innocent
blank photographic plate, so the influence of Brakelond
on the last child of its history must bring out in
her nature new moods and unguessed colours of mind
that had lain dormant in the undistinguishing atmosphere
of London. And thus Brakelond could not but
set a distinction between Kingston and Gundred.
Between the flaming memories of Brakelond and the
long, quiet, eventless story of Darnley-on-Downe
there must always be a great and significant difference.
Gundred, gentle, unimpassioned, mild and
calm, was yet the daughter of fighting centuries, of
men and women who had lived, suffered, loved and
died magnificently, flamboyantly, full in the eye of
the world. She was the daughter of a ruling race.</p>

<p>And he, emotional, energetic, ambitious, was sprung
from an interminable line of sterling, honest mediocrities.
Great glories, great sorrows had avoided
Darnley-on-Downe; the crashing crises in the House
of Mortimer had no parallel in the long unchronicled
history of the Dadds. No more than his wife could he
escape from his traditions. And those traditions, well-bred,
decent, honest though they were, yet were not
the traditions of a ruling race. Inconspicuousness was
their keynote. And Kingston found himself an alien
in the citadel of the dead Mortimers. Their ghosts,
insolent, gorgeous, tyrannous, looked down with contempt
on the colourless shadows of all the sober Dadds.
Those ghosts had ruled, in their great day, over
counties of Dadds, over legions of good honest gentlemen<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
of coat-armour who had been glad and proud
to take service under the banner of the Mortimers.
The House of March, perpetually struggling for
sovereignty, had drawn to its service squires and
knights innumerable from all the counties that it
ruled. And the sense of feudal over-lordship was
strong in the inherited blood of the Mortimers, even
to the uttermost generation. Those others, those
lesser people, noble and gentle, were but small and
insignificant in the eyes of men and women who had
violently swayed the destinies of England. They were
loyal subjects, those others, perhaps, but equals and
allies never. And now a man of the obscure order was
lawful possessor of the last Mortimer. Queens and
the sons of Kings had been, in old days, the mates
of Brakelond; and the Castle seemed as if it could
never accustom itself to the formal ownership, even to
the presence, of one who might in former years have
been squire or feudatory, indeed, to some Lord or Lady
of March, but who could never, in the wildest upheaval
of King Henry’s time, have hoped to become the
master of a Mortimer.</p>

<p>Gundred had given her whole heart to her husband.
But now, in the shadow of all her ancient selves, something
began to thrill in her veins that was more than
the mere pride of part-proprietorship in a splendid
and historic house. An old house, soaked in all the
personalities of a thousand bygone years, must needs
retain the flavour and fragrance of them; and on one
who in his own person resumes the lives of twenty generations,
the compelling influence of his home, the scene
and material of all those lives that throb again in his,
must necessarily be so dominant that insensibly he
takes the colour of the past by which he is surrounded.
If this was so in the case of Kingston, hampered and
controlled by all the decent ancestors that had lived<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
and died unnoticeably in Darnley-on-Downe, it was
likely that the effect would be far more obvious in
the case of one whose own character was so neutral as
Gundred’s, and whose ancestors were so terrific and
blazing as the Mortimers. From every flagstone,
from every wall, pressed out upon Gundred the influence
of some masterful forefather; and in her quiet
nature here and there a secret nerve or fibre, latent
hitherto, and unsuspected, recognised the call of the
soul in which it once had formed a part, and thrilled to
life again. At Brakelond Gundred insensibly took the
lead. It was she that decided to settle in the little
ancient wooden wing that jutted away from the main
mass of the Castle out upon the spur of cliff by the
Chapel of King Mark. Her gentle manner grew more
and more imbued with sovereignty, and her husband
found himself now amused and now rebuffed by Gundred’s
obvious sense of being at home. Away in
London she might be anyone in general, or no one in
particular, concealed her family pride in the Mortimers,
was able to give her zeal for morality full sway
in the condemnation of Queen Isabel. But at Brakelond
her own individuality was swamped. Half reluctantly
at first, but soon openly and even proudly,
she began to contemplate the career of the wicked
Queen, and exalted her with faint damnation that soon
passed into positive sympathy. She spent her days unfolding
to her husband all the nooks and secrets of the
Castle. And, whereas normally she was a person of the
most sensitive and neat-minded righteousness, hating
fierce crimes, frigidly abominating love-intrigues, here
in Brakelond her sense of right and wrong was in abeyance,
and at times she canvassed old bloodstained stories
with an unmoral calm, and a manner that admitted a
not uncomplacent participation in their horrors.</p>

<p>To Kingston it became a relief to hear her retailing<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
the legends of her house. The honeymoon, in its
undiluted intimacy, may well become a strain. However
much two people may have to say to each other,
the knowledge that there is absolutely no one else at
hand to speak to may well impart that itch of rebellion
which most people experience when bowed
under the yoke of necessity. Not to be able to do a
thing often brings the wish to do it; a wish which,
without the prohibition, might never have occurred.
So an enforced duet may occasion faint hankerings
after an occasional trio.</p>

<p>In a honeymoon, too, after the first emotional stress
and glory are over, a revulsion well may threaten&mdash;a
revulsion to which ardent lovers are more liable than
those couples who have married on lower calmer
levels, and who, having never risen to great ecstatic
heights, can never, therefore, fall to the emotionalist’s
profound abysses of languor and depression. And, if
two people shut up together in a lighthouse, with the
hope of some day parting, develop insane, irrelevant
furies against each other’s ways, how much greater
danger of disillusionment must there be for a man and
woman forced into minute prolonged contemplation
of one another, with no reasonable hope of any release
on this side of the grave. The most passionate love
leaps over crimes and vices in the loved object; but
stumbles at times over a personal habit, a veil ill-tied,
a faulty taste in hats. The Ideal is a high and holy
empyrean where love can range unfettered and unimperilled;
the kingdom of daily life is a lumpy and
uneven territory where the winged feet of emotion are
apt to trip over some mean, unlooked-for obstacle.
And the honeymoon is a time for complete revelation
of personal as well of spiritual peculiarities, in which
the veil of mystery is finally torn away from the nude
reality of two people’s lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>Kingston and Gundred began insensibly to enter on
that period of prosaic exploration which lies between
the mystic raptures of the first hours and the later
harmonies of settled married life. The day of blind
passion seemed over. Gundred found herself commenting
inwardly on Kingston’s habits; the smell of
tobacco was no longer so precious to her as in the days
when it stood for part of an enthralling enigma; his
ways were untidy, he dropped the newspapers on the
floor and never picked them up, he wrote his letters at
odd times instead of setting aside a definite hour for
correspondence; he was never in really good time for
meals. And then he had mannerisms which, in the
dual solitude, began to prey upon his wife. He sometimes
walked up and down the room like a bear in a
cage, until she wanted to scream; when he sat quiet,
he occasionally kept up a maddening succession of little
rhythmical taps with his feet; and, above all, he was
given to whistling. Then in mind, though altogether
precious, of course, and adorable, he had certain flaws.
His religious views were clearly lax, his moral attitude
was not strenuous, he was too eager, too inquisitive,
for Gundred’s intelligence, which preferred to hold on
firmly, with the unswerving trust of the dutiful pupil,
to everything it had received at second-hand. She
took life for granted, considered the scheme of things
very admirable, and her own position in it more admirable
still. Nothing was to be questioned. Therefore
Kingston’s habit, divined or expressed, of accepting
nothing without examination, made his wife feel
worried and restless, as if her mind had mated with an
earthquake. Finally, as the days went by, Kingston
dissatisfied her inmost desires by gradually relaxing
the amorous enthusiasm of their first married days.
It is usually the man who first wearies of conjugal outbursts&mdash;men
having other business in life, and women,<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
under the old primeval dispensation, none. And Gundred’s
discontent was the more exasperating that she
was secretly ashamed of it, and had far too much
personal pride, far too strong a sense of decorum, to
express it. As Kingston grew less and less demonstrative
in his affection, Gundred revenged herself at
once on him and on her own feelings by stiffening herself
into an added primness of factitious maidenhood,
by which she had the power of holding herself aloof
from her nearest and dearest, as well as of repelling
that very sense of intimacy that her own most secret
soul desired. Her soul was of those that render themselves
to no subduing warmth of love, but, whatever
the fate of the body, must be violated, if possible, and
taken by assault.</p>

<p>Kingston, for his part, found that marriage had not
dissipated or broken the spiritual barrier between himself
and Gundred. Her citadel was still locked against
him, inexpugnable, not to be captured by any guile or
violence. There were still great heavy gaps in their
conversation, great tracts of desert country across
which their souls were incapable of taking hands.
The calm beatitude that Kingston had foreseen began
to reveal itself a state of something not unlike sterility,
diversified with moments of irritation when he skirmished
round the stone walls of Gundred’s guarded
mind, and only succeeded in bruising himself, no
matter how furiously he attacked. She could not be
led, forced, cajoled, kissed, harried, or bullied into
understanding. A sense of hopelessness sometimes
seized him before the sweet indomitable obstinacy of
her mind. It was at once so hard that no blow could
make an impression, and so soft that no blow could
strike home. Unlike Anne Elliot in all else, her
manners&mdash;of mind and body alike&mdash;‘were as consciously
right as they were invariably gentle.’ That<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
invariable, gentle consciousness of rectitude was
cruelly trying to the restless, questioning, agile temper
of her husband. He longed to stir up its provoking
serenity, to stick pins into its lethargic mass. But
nothing, no effort of his, could move it, shake it, upset
that tranquil self-complacence. It was like grappling
with a phantom in a nightmare. Neither men nor
angels could ever turn Gundred Darnley from an
opinion or a habit. She knew that her outer and her
inner woman alike were both thoroughly, faultlessly
dressed, in the best-fitting, most suitable garments,
and no jot or tittle would she alter of her physical or
mental trimmings. Neat, not gaudy, was her equipment,
and, secure of perfection, she could not conceive
the possibility of any improvement.</p>

<p>That was another thing&mdash;her neatness was something
inhuman, something almost appalling. She always
put everything back in its place, always folded up the
papers and laid them down tidily on the table when
she had finished them, always devoted the hour after
breakfast and after tea to the writing of letters, was
always dressed and ready exactly a minute before the
gong sounded. Neat, neat, heartlessly neat, were all
her proceedings, from the way she docketed her
ideas to the way she buttoned her boots and did her
hair. True it was, indeed, that the maid was responsible
for these details, but she, too, had evidently been
mastered by Gundred’s devastating tidiness. Never a
thought mislaid, never a curl misplaced, never too
much or too little of anything, no excess, no enthusiasm,
no hot outbursts, nothing but a serenely equable
development, as cruel and crushing in its steady, remorseless
movements as the advance of a steam-roller.
If she sat, she sat with perfect correctness:
feet in the proper position, hands folded in her lap, or
prettily occupied with some pretty piece of work. If<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
she walked, it was crisply, concisely, without softness
or undulations, erect, well-modulated, and poised in
the certainty of faultlessness. And the very qualities
that had so appealed to Kingston’s fastidiousness a
month before, now became a terror when he contemplated
a lifetime’s endurance of them. To see Gundred
ruffled, muddy, untidy, would have been as great
a joy to him as water in the wilderness; but no wind
ever tumbled the orderly daintiness of her hair, no
gale ever pushed her hat out of place, no mud ever
dared adhere to her brilliant little boots. Never tired,
never angry, never out of looks, Gundred was also
never buoyant, never ecstatic, never radiant, and the
bland sweet monotony of her threatened to become
as maddening to her husband as the incessant repetition
of one level, unvarying note.</p>

<p>One or two small habits she had, too, which exasperated
him at times. She was fond, for one thing
among others, of talking about God in a frequent,
casual way that he found intolerable in its assumption
of intimacy, and in its cheapening of the soul’s most
private thoughts. God’s, to Gundred, was the biggest
name on her visiting-list, and she displayed it with a
pride that people quite devoid of terrestrial vulgarity
sometimes think it allowable to display when talking of
their acquaintance in celestial circles. Her soul had
a tinge of supramundane snobbishness, and though, on
earth, she would not have thanked a Queen for a kiss,
she took a gentle satisfaction in emphasizing her possession
of the Almighty’s approving friendship. She
conceived heaven as an enormously magnified and
everlasting Court-concert, where only the “nicest”
people were admitted, and where she herself was not
only to have the entrée, but to be in the very heart
of the royal set.</p>

<p>She had, besides, a way of appending an interrogative<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
‘yes’ to every other sentence, which, by degrees,
drove her husband to distraction. He found himself
looking ahead for it along the conversation as one
looks ahead for the next telegraph-pole on a slow
journey. And as surely as the telegraph-pole that
‘yes’ would come, maddening him with the certainty
of its reiteration.</p>

<p>Brakelond, accordingly, was a relief to both husband
and wife&mdash;how great a relief they neither of them
knew. They could take refuge from themselves
among the ghosts of the dead Mortimers. Gundred
almost grew excited as she repeated the stories of her
people, and the spirits of the dead seemed to fill her
veins with some of the blood she apparently lacked.
A stark thorny tree it was, to have borne, at the last,
so mild and white a bud as she. Always in opposition,
always ambitious, always unscrupulous, maniacs
in persecution, in martyrdom, in love, the Mortimers
had risen and fallen, tempestuously fighting, up and
down the steps of the throne. Ruined with Queen
Isabel, they had survived only to fall again before the
House of York. With the Tudors their glory towered
once more, until a characteristically ambitious attempt
to marry the Queen of Scots had destroyed the March
of the time. Then, after a few years of comparative
quiet, they had risen conspicuous as the only great
house that had sided with the country against King
Charles. This unpopular piece of patriotism forced
the Mortimers into discreet seclusion through Restoration
days, until a new opportunity of manifesting it
arrived with the Great Revolution. The House of
March, always especially patriotic when patriotism
involved enmity to the Crown, had had a narrow
escape of ruin at the time of King Monmouth’s disaster,
and, for its safety, the Prince of Orange did not
land a day too soon. His coming, however, with the<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
comparative loyalty that followed, and its resultant
dukedom, had established March and Brakelond in
that period of slow prosperity which had led on through
two centuries of gradual inanition to its present effete
or atrophied state. It seemed as if the furious old
Castle and the furious old race that owned it could
not live fully nor thrive without that atmosphere of
violence in which they had so often gloried and
agonized together. Peace&mdash;slackening, corroding, monotonous&mdash;was
fatal to the vitality of the Mortimers.</p>

<p>But, despite the obvious influence exerted by the
Castle on the individuality of Gundred, Kingston could
not but be struck again and again by the contrast
between his pin-neat, impeccable wife, orderly in
mind, body, desires, and the many riotous scarlet
lives that she summed up in her own neutral-tinted
nature. Always turbulent, always passionate, impatient
of rule, loving and hating without limit or bond of
reason, breathing the air of battle from birth to death,
and flagging in the close air of peace, the Mortimers
were a strange race to end thus, in a woman to whom
peace, order, reason, limit were the very conditions
of her being. As she talked to him of her people,
Kingston noticed the small, flickering flames of vitality
that leapt up in her nature out of the dead past. Here
and there in her utterance from time to time some bygone
tyrant dictated an inflection, some dead Queen
contributed a thought. Kingston heard these voices
so distinctly, noticed so clearly the occurrence of each
foreign thought that twanged abruptly in the music
of Gundred’s voice, like the sudden throb of a harp
across a piano’s level ripplings, that it seemed to him
at last as if, at moments, she were the mere mouthpiece
of ghosts. For a vanishing instant, now and then, her
lips spoke what her mind had not conceived, what her
heart had not sanctioned. She was possessed by a<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
fragment of the life that had gone before. But was
this all? Robbers and wantons that they were in
their lawless splendour, had the Mortimers given their
descendant nothing beyond these fragmentary reminiscences?
Was there in her, far down under the orderly,
decorous placidity of her surface, no stirring possibility
of those old primitive passions, of those fierce
blood-lusts or those religious frenzies, that should have
come with the very fabric of her life out of the buried
long-ago? The question was strangely interesting, in
the bizarre contrast between the neat, methodical
thing she was, and the wild daughter of the past that,
by some freak of fortune, she might perhaps again
become. Kingston watched her keenly, hoping that
some day, sooner or later, might raise again the hidden
depths of her nature, and reveal, in a tempest of
passion, the frantic possibilities of the Mortimers.
The idea was inconceivable, monstrous, grotesque;
but attractive as a romantic paradox. As with most
paradoxes, deep down in his heart he utterly disbelieved
it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>


<p>Kingston Darnley, as usual, was late for breakfast.
He had loitered pleasantly over his toilet, relieving
the repellent prose of the process by frequent intervals
of poetic rest at the open window. The little old
diamond-paned casement of his dressing-room was
open, and the crooked oak-panelled apartment was
flooded with morning sunlight. Very far below,
against the feet of the cliff beneath, the blue and gold
of the clear water came lapping in friendship, and its
lazy utterance rose faint and thin to the listener
through the virginal clarity of the air. The day was
not yet old enough for the haze and stress of heat: all<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
was still clean and fresh from the cool sweetness of the
night and the unclouded dawn. To the uttermost
horizon spread the level floor of the sea, a glory of
scent and colour, gleaming, vital, incredibly buoyant
and young for all its uncounted æons of life.
Again and again Kingston stayed to dally with the
enormous loveliness of life, leaning from the window
whence he might have dropped a pebble straight into
the purple ripples a hundred feet and more below,
where they played leisurely at hide-and-seek among
the rocks under the cliff.</p>

<p>It was indeed a morning to be up and alive&mdash;a
morning to be naked in the naked embrace of the
world. As the hours go by, the world, no less than
man, puts on its clothes. Clouds and shadows and
haze come up to cover the strong free limbs of the
earth. It is only in the short space after sunrise in
some still morning that the world stands out pure and
glorious in its nudity&mdash;vivid, stainless, triumphant as
the white flawlessness of the young Apollo newly risen
out of the dark, formless void. The upspringing day
is our emblem of youth fresh from slumber&mdash;beautiful,
ardent, splendid in the clear glory of his build&mdash;before
he makes haste to hide himself in the sombre,
ugly trappings of convention. Kingston was in no
haste to take that leap of many centuries that separates
man, as Nature set him forth, from the clothed, shapeless
dummy that man has made himself.</p>

<p>From the adjoining room his wife recalled him again
and again to the flight of time. She was never to be
distracted from her duties by any beauty or ugliness
of the outer world. Had the Last Day dawned in
fire, Gundred would have duly finished having her hair
done before confronting it. There is a time for everything,
she says, and all reasonable people know that
the time for looking at landscapes is after lunch, while<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
taking one’s afternoon drive, before going home to tea
and the second post. Then, at the proper moment,
ecstasies are allowable, and even suitable. But every
minute of the day has its task, and nothing can be
plainer than that dressing-time is the time to dress.
Kingston, however, whistled idly at his desultory
work, and dawdled as if the whole forthcoming week
were vacant. He loved the young tenderness of the
sunlight, and drew great breaths of life at the open
window. Overhead, and far away to the right,
stretched along the cliff a mighty, menacing shaft of
darkness, the shadow of the huge Castle behind. But
this little old wing, on its spur of rock, jutted so boldly
out from the main mass of the building that all here
was radiance. Gundred, too, enjoyed the sun, but
did not allow his ardours to distract her from her
duties. She had the white blinds pulled down, and her
toilet was cheered merely by a subdued consciousness
of the warmth outside. Then, when all was carefully
and properly accomplished, she made her way down
twisting steps, and along a strip of corridor, to the end
of the wing, where the last two rooms on this ground-floor
were portioned off as dining-room and sitting-room.
The whole arrangement was quaint enough to
please her, but neither so inconvenient nor so unusual
as to offend her sense of what was becoming. It was
better than living, sitting and dining, in the grim,
mouldering halls of the Drum Tower, or in the bald,
chintz-hung rooms of the modern wings.</p>

<p>The unexpected booming of the gong roused Kingston
to a sense of time. With an effort he tore himself from
his ecstatic contemplation, and compressed the remainder
of his toilet into half a dozen crowded moments.
Then, flurried, and filled with the feeling that he ought
to be apologetic, he hurried towards the dining-room.</p>

<p>He found his wife seated at the breakfast-table,<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
decapitating a boiled egg with her usual crisp neatness,
which always suggested that she was doing the
egg a favour in making it an example of exactly how
an egg should be eaten. She was a lesson to the
world. And he felt that she knew it.</p>

<p>She, for her part, noticed immediately that his tie
was under one ear, that it was exceedingly ill-knotted,
and that it was the wrong sort of tie for that particular
collar.</p>

<p>‘I thought I would begin, darling,’ said Gundred.
‘I did not know when you would appear. Such a
lovely morning&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Here, also, she had shown her appreciation of its
loveliness by having all the blinds drawn down. A
muffled white radiance was all that she allowed to
reach her from outside.</p>

<p>Kingston, meanwhile, had been collecting letters and
papers from the sideboard.</p>

<p>‘Letters for you, my dear,’ he said; ‘three.’</p>

<p>‘Leave them there, darling, will you? I never look
at my letters till after breakfast. It is so nice to make
a habit of everything&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Her husband, returning to the table, helped himself
and sat down. For a time the meal went forward in
silence. Then he looked across at his wife with intense
approval. In the softened light Gundred looked
wonderfully pretty. The table was bare&mdash;a piece of
oak too beautiful to hide&mdash;and beyond its dark surface,
where silver, glass, and white china gleamed and
glittered, Gundred’s head and shoulders rose in soft
relief against a very old painted panel on the further
wall, a dim, dingy portrait of King Henry the Seventh.
Before her on the table stood a bowl of pink and
salmon-coloured sweet-peas. In the dim, primeval
room, in the quiet mellowed glow, she struck a note of
exquisite modernity. The curled gold of her hair,<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
the small clear features, the inconspicuously perfect
gown harmonized, in the very audacity of their contrast,
with the ripened antiquity that surrounded her.
She touched another octave. From head to foot there
was nothing about her to find fault with. And, against
such a background, her charm was seen more whole
and successful than in a garish setting of modern
furniture and other, showier women.</p>

<p>‘By Jove!’ said Kingston, ‘you do look extraordinary
cool and beautiful, Gundred. How do you
manage it? I don’t believe you could ever grow old!’</p>

<p>Gundred was pleased. Such comments had been
growing too rare. But she was one of those women
who repel what they most desire, whether from motives
of mortification or allurement, it would at first sight
be hard to decide.</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, Kingston dear!’ she said; ‘one gets
older every day. You must really not try to make
me vain.’</p>

<p>‘Never,’ replied her husband, ‘have I seen anyone
who gave me the same perfect feeling of satisfaction
that you do. You always look as if you had just come
out of the smartest bandbox that was ever made. One
can’t realize that it’s all taken to pieces again every
night.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t, dear,’ said Gundred. ‘You are always so
exaggerated. I am so glad I look nice, but it is only
a matter of taking pains. Anybody can be neat&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t. If it weren’t for Andrews, I should
always have odd socks and boots, I am sure I should.
I believe I am capable of wearing an up-and-down
collar in the evening if it was put out for me. What
would you do if I did, Gundred&mdash;divorce me on the
spot?’</p>

<p>‘Darling, don’t talk so lightly about such a dreadful<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
subject. God has joined us together, and of course
I should not think of divorcing you if you came down
to dinner in an up-and-down collar. It would be very
wrong of me. But, oh, Kingston dear, I do hope you
never will. It is so easy to be tidy. Your tie is all
crooked this morning, dear.’</p>

<p>Her husband whistled instead of answering, as he
helped himself to cold ham. A man may let a woman
mend his morals or his mind, but he would rather suffer
any reasonable torture than have it suspected that she
meddles with his clothes.</p>

<p>When Kingston returned to the table Gundred was
ready with a renewed supply of tea. ‘Nice and fresh
and hot,’ she advertised. ‘Let me give you another
cup.’ She poured out for each, adding cream in fair
quantity to her own, and lavishly to her husband’s.
This was a habitual little silent proof of her love for
him, and had no reference to the fact that he particularly
disliked cream in his tea. As for herself, she
expected Kingston always to remember and respect
her avoidance of sugar. But then his tastes were
wrong, while hers were right. For he was Kingston, a
man: and she was Gundred, a good wife.</p>

<p>‘You’ve put cream in,’ protested Kingston, wrying
his mouth at the taste.</p>

<p>‘Have I, dear? I’m so sorry. Take my cup instead.
I have not touched it.’</p>

<p>She gave her cup a rapid final stir to make the cream
disappear amid the tea, then handed it to him, and
watched complacently while he drank it without any
further complaint. She imagined that he was deceived,
and felt herself happily embarked on that
career of small benevolent falsehoods which make so
necessary a part of the good wife’s success. She foresaw
innumerable ways of cheating him for his own
good, of making him eat veal in disguise, of teaching<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
him to like rabbit by serving it up as chicken cream.
As a matter of fact he fully realized what she had done,
but knew that it was useless to make a protest. He had
learnt by now in a fortnight that all opposition to
Gundred’s ideas was unprofitable. She had a firm
notion that cream was good for him. Therefore cream
he was evidently doomed to have, for the sake of
domestic peace&mdash;and in quantities, too, as generous as
the love that poured them out. Gundred had the
bland pertinacity of the martyr, combined with the
imperturbable self-complacence of the Pharisee. Before
her gentle, inexorable determinations all hostile resolves
were as the stone which an incessant drip of
water permeates and dissolves.</p>

<p>Kingston swallowed his polluted tea as quickly as
possible; then, breakfast being over, began to think of
the day’s news. He offered his wife a paper.</p>

<p>‘Letters first, thank you, dear,’ said Gundred, seating
herself concisely on a small, stiff-backed settle. She
always preferred hard and rigid furniture to the
cushions and softnesses that nowadays prevail. She
felt them more virtuous, more decent, more suitable.
She turned towards her husband. ‘Take the arm-chair,
dear,’ she said.</p>

<p>There was but one in the room that had any pretensions
to comfort. Kingston, finding that Gundred
was determined to remain where she was, settled himself
in it with his papers.</p>

<p>‘Kingston, dear,’ pleaded his wife suddenly, ‘you
won’t leave the papers all anyhow on the floor, will
you? It’s so untidy&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>For answer he softly whistled a snatch, then, growing
absorbed in the news, began abstractedly to drum
a small rhythm on the oaken floor. Gundred bore it
for a moment. Then a combined instinct of martyrdom
and love rebellious stirred her to action. She<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
rose and picked up a small cushion that happened to
be on the settle, a bony little unyielding square,
prickly and stiff with embroideries that tradition
attributed to Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>‘A cushion, darling,’ said Gundred in level tones,
standing behind his chair. ‘Move your back&mdash;sit up
a little, and let me arrange it for you.’</p>

<p>Her utterance, her action, were characteristic of her
nature. The utterance decorous, cold, impassive, the
action springing from an unresting love. Neither from
her words nor from their inflection could Kingston
have guessed the warmth of the affection that beamed
out of her eyes as she stood looking down at the back
of his neck with an ardour which she would have been
utterly ashamed to show to his face. Only by such
attentions as these, valuable as symptoms of her concealed
devotion, could Kingston ever make a guess at
her feelings.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, dearest,’ he replied gratefully, shifting
himself so as to admit the insertion of Queen Elizabeth’s
uncomfortable comfort. It harassed him, its
adamantine corners cut into his ribs and the small of
his back, but as an emblem of his wife’s tenderness he
endured and welcomed it. What she zealously concealed
from him in word she was perpetually anxious
to reveal vicariously by such actions as these. ‘Thanks
awfully,’ he repeated, then twisted round, so as to get
a glimpse of Gundred’s face. Instantly the light
faded out of her eyes, and all she allowed him to see
was a decent wifely expression of solicitude. He never
divined that any other had been there.</p>

<p>But suddenly she permitted herself a word of self-betrayal.</p>

<p>‘I always want you to be comfortable, dear,’ she
said. The words were cool and coolly spoken, but
under them lay the warmth of Gundred’s secret nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>Kingston, fired by such an advance, rose and swung
round. He caught his wife’s two hands&mdash;those charming
hands that were never hot or cold.</p>

<p>‘I owe you something for that,’ he said, and kissed
her twice.</p>

<p>Very gently Gundred drew herself away. Her heart
was afire with gratification, but she felt that every
consideration of decency, economy, and pride compelled
her to conceal it. To be made cheap was the
last horror that her mind could imagine; and all outward
displays seemed to level her with kitchen-maids
and factory-girls.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be so boisterous, darling,’ she remonstrated,
while her heart longed to thank him for what he had
done, and beg him to do it again. In the daytime,
however, the invisible audience before whom she lived
forbade these manifestations; only under the cover
of darkness could she feel them permissible. ‘It is
too early in the day,’ said Gundred, patting into place
a curl that had never been out of it.</p>

<p>Not for the first time Kingston sighed and found himself
baffled by his wife’s perpetual assumption of virginity.
Beyond the reach of all allowed caresses, her
soul remained untouched, immaculate. The bloodless
chastity of temperament that invested this last of
Queen Isabel’s offspring was for ever a barrier between
man and wife. And neither Kingston nor Gundred
had any doubt as to whether the barrier were natural
or artificial. Both believed it an essential part of
Gundred’s nature. If Gundred herself ever doubted,
she stifled the doubt as ill-bred, repulsive, almost
irreligious.</p>

<p>‘Ice-house!’ cried Kingston. ‘One may kiss your lips,
but the real you is far away beyond the reach of kisses.’</p>

<p>Gundred knew that this was not true, longed to
deny it, yet was glad that her husband thought it.<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
She was taking a shamefaced, almost fierce delight in
the dialogue. For once her correct coldness had
proved a challenge. Too often she had grieved that
the low temperature of her behaviour was passing unregretted,
unnoticed, and was even beginning to lower
the temperature of her lover. Cold she still wished to
be, for pride and decorum, yet without paying any of
the penalties. The personal intimacy that one aspect
of marriage enforces only the more impelled her soul,
for the sake of its stiff self-respect, to take refuge in all
possible mental reservations and seclusions, by way
of indemnifying itself and justifying itself for the other
candours into which Nature had driven her, not unwilling,
indeed, but always feeling that she ought to
be unwilling. Gundred’s temperament was civilized
very far below the surface, and the rough facts of life
never ceased to strike her as monstrous and barbaric.
And most barbarous of all was her own surprised
acquiescence. She could only recapture her vanishing
dignity by emphasizing at every possible moment the
immaculate maidenhood of her mind. This was at once
her revenge on Nature, and on herself for loving what
Nature sent. But her husband could not understand
these subtleties; no clue was given him to the labyrinth
of Gundred’s hidden emotions; he took her at her face-value,
and imagined her as deeply, incurably frigid as
was the manner that she thought proper to assume.</p>

<p>He stood before her, still holding her hands, gazing
hotly into the depths of her cool eyes. But now they
gave him no answering light. Shallow, clear, and
cold, they met his own without a tremor. No soul
looked out of them.</p>

<p>‘The real you,’ he repeated at last, after a long pause&mdash;‘the
real you. Where is it, I wonder? Or is there
any such thing? I thought once I could thaw you, but
one can’t thaw an icicle unless one can get near it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>The passion of his speech pleased her no less than the
success of her own decorous hypocrisy. Now evidently
she was winning the demonstrations for which she
secretly hungered, and without any sacrifice of her
pudicity.</p>

<p>She drew her hands away.</p>

<p>‘Let me go, dear,’ she said, with mild decision. ‘You
make me feel hot and rumpled. If you want to kiss
me&mdash;well, I suppose I am your wife&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>The tacit invitation, the unexpressed desire, were
too successfully concealed by the decorous dullness of
her tone. He read into it annoyance and disgust.
Abruptly the flame of his mood was extinguished.
He dropped her hands, so suddenly that they, not
expecting any such desertion, hung limp and disappointed
for a moment in the air.</p>

<p>‘Sorry to have bothered you,’ he said. ‘I suppose I
am too rough.’</p>

<p>Without another word he subsided again into his
chair, and fell to reading the paper. Gundred retired
to her settle, feeling how glad she ought to feel thus
triumphantly to have vindicated her sense of decency.
But her satisfaction was hollow; her soul had received
a shock when her hands had been so suddenly dropped&mdash;a
nasty jarring shock such as one receives in a dream,
stepping into vacancy where one had expected solid
ground. Her hands fell slowly to her sides, cheated,
frustrated; then set languidly about opening her
letters, as if diverted from their proper use. It was a
minute or two before she could concentrate her attention.
In her turn she experienced something of that
snubbed, humiliated sensation which she had so often
inflicted on her husband. Then good training conquered
personal disappointment, and she began to
read. In an instant her attention was chained.</p>

<p>‘Kingston,’ she cried, looking up, ‘here is a letter<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
from Isabel Darrell, of all people in the world. She
wants to pay us a visit. Why, I declare,’ she added,
‘Isabel writes from London. I must say she loses no
time.’</p>

<p>‘Isabel Darrell?’ questioned Kingston. ‘Who is
she, and what does she want with us&mdash;especially now,
when we are supposed to be on our honeymoon?’</p>

<p>‘My cousin,’ Gundred reminded him. ‘Her mother
was my father’s sister, Isabel Mortimer. Don’t you
remember, I told you about her? Poor Aunt Isabel!
She married a dreadful man who came over from
Australia or New Zealand, and took her back there,
and led her a most terrible life, I am afraid. Aunt
Isabel died three years ago, and now her husband
seems to have died, too, and the daughter has come to
England to see her own people. We shall have to have
her here, Kingston. I must write at once. I’ll let
her have a line by this morning’s post. But I do wish
Aunt Agnes ever wrote letters: we ought to have heard
of Isabel’s arrival at least a week ago. We must certainly
send for her at once.’</p>

<p>Gundred wanted her husband to protest against this
sacrifice of their privacy, perhaps to forbid it. If he
had done so, she would have resisted his objections,
and eventually have made a wifely virtue of yielding
to them. But the best of people are not without their
small ungenerosities, and Kingston Darnley was in a
mood to punish his wife for her obstinate chilliness.
If their privacy were to give no real intimacy, it might
just as well cease.</p>

<p>‘Capital!’ said Kingston. ‘We want someone to
liven us up a bit. Write to your cousin and tell her
to come here at once. She’ll be someone for you to
talk to.’</p>

<p>‘Won’t she&mdash;yes?’ assented Gundred, wounded
indeed, but quite successful in concealing the fact.<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
‘Poor thing! I will send her a wire. She can be here
by dinner-time. How odd of her, though, to think
one likes being interrupted on one’s honeymoon! Do
you suppose they do that kind of thing in the colonies?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t know. I dare say she heard we had
been here for more than a fortnight, and thought we
must have had about enough of it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it will be very nice. Would you like to see
her letter?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t mind,’ answered Kingston indifferently.
In the circumstances wild horses would not have
forced him to confess how much he resented the invasion.
Not even to himself would he confess it.
But already he had conceived a keen dislike for his
cousin, Isabel Darrell.</p>

<p>‘Quite an odd letter,’ commented Gundred; ‘not
at all like anyone else’s. My poor aunt was always
strange and eccentric&mdash;evidently Isabel takes after her
mother.’</p>

<p>‘Let me see,’ said Kingston, in the hope of finding
something to feed his feeling for Isabel Darrell.</p>

<p>Gundred handed him the letter. It was written in
a large, flamboyant hand, on large flamboyant paper;
twirls and flourishes abounded, and the signature was
written with a sprawling arrogance that might have
done credit to a second-rate actress.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear my Cousin</span>,’ it began,</p>

<p class="p-1">‘I have come to England at last, to enter the
bosom of my family. My father, to the relief of everybody,
has entered Abraham’s. Don’t think me flippant,
but one cannot always mourn, not even for the worst of
parents. Meanwhile, here am I in London, buying frocks
so as not to disgrace my family. When can I come to
you? As soon as you like. A wire will fetch me. I
understand that your honeymoon is nearly over, so I<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
don’t suppose a casual third will be much of a nuisance
by now. And, anyhow, I have nowhere else to go. I
am dying to see Brakelond, too, and the ducal great-uncle.
Aunt Agnes and I have had quite enough of
each other in a week, but she has been doing her duty
nobly by the returned prodigal. Really, she is too
weird for words. I believe she thinks New Zealand is
the capital of Australia, or else the other way round.</p>

<p class="ir0 p-1"><span style="padding-right:4em">‘Your affectionate and only cousin,</span><br />
‘<span class="smcap">Isabel Darrell, of the Mortimers</span>.’</p></div>

<p>Kingston found himself amply justified in his dislike.
Underbred, loud, vulgar, evidently Isabel Darrell
was a very undesirable specimen of the colonial. Her
clashing presence would teach him anew to appreciate
the quiet perfection of Gundred. He returned the letter
with a laugh.</p>

<p>‘So very odd&mdash;yes?’ said Gundred; ‘just like her
poor dear mother. Aunt Isabel was just the same&mdash;so
flaunting, and independent, and unconventional.
Isabel must be the oddest girl.’</p>

<p>‘She sounds a shocking bounder,’ said Kingston.</p>

<p>‘She is my cousin, dear,’ said Gundred, very gently,
after a slight pause. The emphasis was slight but unmistakable.
Another pause followed.</p>

<p>‘And when are we to expect that sacrosanct person,
your cousin?’ inquired Kingston, who knew nothing of
that calm loyalty which people of Gundred’s sort display
towards even the most despised and detested of
their relations when they come up for discussion in the
presence of anyone unconnected with ‘the family.’</p>

<p>‘Isabel? Ring, dear, for Murchison, and I will
send a wire. She will have time to catch the midday
train, and we shall have her here in good time to
dress for dinner. But of course she won’t be able to
see poor Uncle Henry.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[102]</span></p>

<p>Kingston rang, feeling himself powerless to avert the
coming of this discordant, pestilent alien, and Murchison
was duly entrusted with the telegram. As soon
as it had gone both Kingston and Gundred began to
feel injured, and by common consent forbore to say
another word about Isabel Darrell. Gundred felt herself
aggrieved that her husband should so readily and
with such apparent gladness have consented to the
invasion of a stranger; Kingston felt himself aggrieved
that Gundred should so gladly and with such apparent
readiness have suggested the importation of a third
person. Each thought the other bored with the
honeymoon; neither was, but the one from offended
pride, and the other from conscientious delicacy considered
it a duty to make the pretence; and, each
concealing his feeling strictly from the other, husband
and wife drew deliberately apart to make room for
the figure of Isabel Darrell between them.</p>

<p>The day drifted by in colourless talk, and the fine
splendour of the morning grew clouded with a leaden
haze. Kingston and Gundred sat out the hours in
the small close garden that was shut in by the Castle.
Their own little oaken wing jutted away ahead of them,
but the line of the cliff, before it ran out in that unexpected
spur, was enclosed by three old towers of the
building, and here, in the square levelled space, looking
straight over the boundless sea, with a battlemented
wall of windows behind, and the Drum Tower glooming
high over it in the background, had been made the only
patch of garden that existed to give light and life to the
grey mountain of masonry. The little flowery patch, gay
with sweet-peas and roses, seemed as discordant with
the Castle as a bow of ribbon on the brow of a precipice.
It was frivolous, impertinent, saucy in its defiance of
the stern greyness that it adorned. The only fit colours
to relieve the sombre majesty of Brakelond were those<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
of blood and fire, not those of grass and flowers. But
the contradiction was so flagrant as to be fascinating,
and the lovers took daily joy in this little impudent oasis.</p>

<p>However, their unuttered thoughts of the new-comer
dominated every remark they made, and it was
a relief when evening drew near, and each minute
brought nearer and nearer the abrupt termination of
their solitude. Isabel had telegraphed her joy at
being permitted to come, and her intention to do so
immediately. Orders were given to prepare for her,
and she was expected to arrive in time to dress for
dinner. When, therefore, the carriage returned empty
from the station, six miles away, after having kept
dinner waiting for half an hour, both Kingston and
Gundred felt their grievances redoubled. Kingston
saw how right he had been to detest the very notion
of this disorderly stranger, and Gundred realized more
than ever how slack and neglectful of her husband it
had been not to forbid the importation of such a disconcerting
element into their ordered tranquillity.
Meanwhile a telegram arrived, explaining that Isabel
had lost her train, had taken a ‘special,’ and hoped to
arrive in an hour or so. Again the carriage was sent,
and, after another tedious interval of expectation the
lovers were told that its lights could be seen returning
up the hill. To ease the arrival of a shy, desolate
colonial Gundred decided to receive her in the great
hall itself. Accordingly, at the news, Kingston and
Gundred passed on through the dim, gaunt passages
of outwork and bastion until they found themselves at
last in the heart of the big Drum Tower. The hall
was a vast flagged expanse, walled in by high, dusty
glooms, into whose recesses no light of any feeble
lamp or lantern could penetrate. Grime and weary
antiquity seemed to permeate it, and the air was close
and heavy with a scent of mouldered greatness.<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
Kingston, as he went, began insensibly to play a game
with himself. He picked out the names of four moods,
to be repeated to himself, one for each flag on which
he trod; and his fate, his whole attitude to Isabel was
to be foretold by the paving-stone on which his foot
should rest at the instant of the new-comer’s alighting.
His fancy was taken from the game which children play
with their cherry-stones, and the moods he chose were
‘Love, Hate, Fear, Contempt.’ In turn he repeated
them as he stepped from flag to flag, careful always
never to set his foot on any boundary line. ‘Love,
Hate, Fear, Contempt,’ he murmured inwardly from
stone to stone, while Gundred walked briskly at his
side, her clear mind a hundred years removed from
any such silly infantile fantasies. Now they were
drawing near the huge, gaping doorway. There were
not so many of the great squares left to tread, and the
jingling approach of the carriage could be more and
more clearly heard. Kingston’s heart began to beat
with the artificial excitement of his game. ‘Love,
Hate, Fear, Contempt....’ The carriage had driven
up.... ‘Love, Hate, Fear, Contempt....’ He
lingered, hoping that the stranger would alight appropriately
on the word ‘Contempt.’ In vain. There
was some delay. Perforce he must advance to the
three or four remaining flag-stones. Quickly, to get it
over without danger, he hurried with a long stride
on to the stone that meant ‘Love,’ eager to leap to the
next. But the unconscious Isabel was quicker. As
his foot was set on ‘Love,’ Isabel jumped untidily
from the carriage. Kingston laughed internally. ‘So
much for fate,’ he thought; then, calmed again, he
advanced with Gundred to meet the stranger. In the
flickering light, among the draughts that swirled in
the high cavern of darkness, his first impression was
of a limp, floppy hat, bulged, overtrodden boots, and<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
a deplorable draggled tippet. Greetings were hurriedly
exchanged, and Kingston felt justified of all his hostile
forebodings. Awkward, shapeless, inopportune, tawdry,&mdash;‘Contempt’
or ‘Hate’ should certainly have been
his footing with regard to Isabel Darrell.</p>

</div>


<p>It was not till the three had arrived in the oaken parlour
of the old chapel wing that Kingston could pause to
take stock of the new-comer, and revise his first impression.
Revise it? It needed only to be amplified,
many new details to be added to the first rough sketch
of his dislike, fresh lines and shades to be stippled in
on the displeasing portrait.</p>

<p>Gundred was one of the comparatively few Englishwomen
whose hat always looks as if it had grown with
her hair, and forms an integral part of her head as
Nature made it. Isabel, on the other hand, was one
of the vast majority whose hat sits on their hair
awkwardly, like a stranger, with no suggestion of anything
more than an accidental and reluctant relationship
painfully achieved with pins. And it was a bad
hat, too&mdash;formless, flabby, large and slatternly in its
lines. It made no pretence at being straight, but
flapped and floundered distressingly as she walked.
Clearly Isabel was one of those women who can never
keep a hat straight. Regiments of daggers and
skewers cannot prevent them from giving the impression
of living perpetually in a gale. Their headgear
is aimless, uncongenial, offering a perpetual suggestion
of irrelevance. And, as the hat is symptomatic of
the woman, the rest of Isabel fulfilled the dire promise
of her headgear&mdash;immense, shapeless, foolishly waved
and undulated, of limp, coarse black straw, with the<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
big bow of cheap satin that did not seem to belong to
it, but to be stuck on casually with one of the protrusive,
jetty pins that ironically pretended to keep it
fixed, and, with it, sagged from side to side in a futile
and disconsolately impudent manner. Isabel, throughout,
was flimsy, loose, and flaccid in design. Nothing
about her seemed to be in any relationship to herself
or to any other detail of her dress: her attire was a mere
careless aggregation of unsuitable elements, as depressing
in its feeble slovenliness as a party of ill-assorted
people. Her gown dragged and trailed around
her here and there, suggesting that she daily tied it on
anew with tapes, and secured the more salient points
with safety-pins. It was not a gown&mdash;no homogeneous
creation of any sane mind. It had none of
a real gown’s individuality; it was a mere haphazard
covering. Then her boots: again, as she sat in the
settle, the lamplight caught their toes: they were
both wrinkled and bulgy, an ingenious prodigy of
the incorrect. As Kingston watched them in the little
oaken room, the lamplight seemed to concentrate its
efforts on their shapeless points: they held his gaze as
if by mesmerism, and seemed to swell monstrously and
waver gigantic in the gloom, till the world was
swallowed up in those amorphous lumps.</p>

<p>It was some time before Kingston could turn his
attention from the clothes to the woman that they so
disastrously symbolized. Here, too, he met at every
point with a violation of all his favourite canons.
Isabel Darrell was evidently as untidy as her garments.
Her figure was long and elastic. Only a certain
arrogant untidiness of carriage could save her from the
reproach of lankiness. She walked with a free unconventional
swing from the hips, with a sort of bounding
spring that might have been more pleasantly noteworthy
had it not set her hat mopping and mowing<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
afresh at every step. At every step it jauntily jumped,
up and down, and from right to left, until the attention
was concentrated on its antics rather than on any
beauties that might have been found in the gait
which compelled them. Very different indeed was
the barbaric looseness of Isabel’s movement from
the neat and civilized precision of Gundred’s every
motion. That she wore no stays was very evident,
and the flapping freedom of her legs suggested that
her nature had been built for breeches rather than for
petticoats.</p>

<p>Her face, when you came to look at it, was not, perhaps,
quite so terrible as might have been expected.
In fact, Kingston found it rather disappointing in its
possibilities. He consoled himself by noticing that
the mouth was ridiculously wide, revealing, too, a
glimpse of gold; but, still, it was an eager, mobile
mouth, full of energetic vitality. Gundred’s pretty,
definite lips invariably preserved their proper lines;
but Isabel’s had smiles and flashes of feeling that kept
no limits and obeyed no conventions. Agile, too,
and expressive beyond due bounds, they had a gleaming
redness that was put to shame by the decent pallor
of her cousin’s. Her face was irregular, uneven, unconventional,
yet not without a certain heady and
unlawful charm. Like her mouth, it was so very much
alive. It did not seem, as did Gundred’s, to be a
moulded mask, but to be the woman’s very own
naked soul. The claim of her birth was clear in the
strangely delicate beauty of her ears&mdash;the only part
of her that could ever, by any possibility, be called
neat or dainty&mdash;and in the firm, fine curves of her
nose and upper lip. The nose especially, swift and
decided in its line, carried high and defiant, had the
long thin nostrils, sensitive, fierce, cruel in their lifted
curve, that one sees in the conspicuous women of old<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
ferocious days. Kingston and Gundred had seen them
in the face of Isabel the Queen.</p>

<p>As for the rest of her character, a student might have
found traces of uncontrolled personality in her broad
forehead, heavy along the supraciliary ridge, and in the
deep set of her eyes. The eyes themselves were big
and ardent, of that grey-green whose precise tone
can never be actually discerned. Golden at one time,
emerald at another, they are always vivid, blazing,
inscrutable. And over all hung in a dense cloud the
heavy obscurity of her hair. Black as darkness it
was, long, straight, and utterly impatient of restraint.
Its arrangement was of a piece with Miss
Darrell’s whole accoutrement. Evidently she was
content with twirling it into a rough lump, poking it
here, pinning it inadequately there. At every point
it burst its bonds: loose coils and ropes were dropping
and trailing unreproved; each movement, each jump
of the hat, set free a fresh strand. Miss Darrell clearly
counted on the hat’s pressure to preserve at least some
semblance of order; but that unhappy adornment was
powerless to exert any influence; it jigged and jolted
as the hair dictated, and the mass on the top of her
head hopped happily in a unanimous heap as she went,
carrying the hat unresisting to its sway.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gundred was pouring forth a stream of
pleasantness. Her gentle voice ran on in an orderly
melody, expounding the joy that she and Kingston
felt in welcoming a kinswoman to Brakelond. And,
as she spoke, not a detail of her cousin’s untidiness
escaped her eye. But the pitying disapproval that she
felt found no hint of expression in her voice. Tone
and manner remained calm, dispassionate, colourless
as ever. Isabel, for her part, had no such nice polish,
and made no attempt to conceal her excitement. Her
eye roved, her head went eagerly from side to side,<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
scanning her surroundings. When Gundred paused,
she interposed some quick question, some keen remark
on what she saw. But to her cousin’s formal little
speeches she was evidently not attending. Her
manners were careless as her dress.</p>

<p>Kingston, taking no part in the dialogue, devoted
himself to watchful criticism of the enemy. He
noticed how the smile flickered and flashed across her
eager face, and how the fine nostrils thrilled and contracted
now and again with enthusiasm. Those
nostrils, he felt, were well known. Where had he
seen them? He did not remember the face of the
She-Wolf Queen, but, as he looked at that of Isabel,
stronger and stronger grew his impression that it was
no stranger. His hostile feelings grew and deepened.
The face, the manner, the charm of Isabel made some
vehement, inexplicable claim upon him; and in his
resistance to so unreasonable a call, his attitude
stiffened itself into a determined enmity. There could
be nothing appealing or desirable about this sloppy,
disorderly creature, yet he felt the beginning&mdash;was it
the beginning or the renewal?&mdash;of a paradoxical
fascination that contradicted his own most cherished
sense of what was admirable. He looked again at
Gundred, and strenuously admired her neat, cool
beauty, the perfection of her appointments, her gestures,
her inflections, her expressions. Nothing was
wrong there; no criticism could be made: it was all
just right; there was the admirable, incarnate.</p>

<p>Thence, his judgment reinforced, his gaze swept
back to Isabel. There it was all just wrong: criticism
could run riot; there, incarnate, was the second-rate.
Second-rate? Blind instinct protested, and pointed
the way to a discovery. Isabel was not second-rate.
By every rule she should have been, but second-rate
she was not. Strangely, unaccountably not. The<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
rules in this case seemed to have collapsed. There, at
all events, was everything that normally makes up the
second-rate&mdash;cheapness, tawdriness, untidiness. But
these items could not be added up to make the expected
total. He hated his consciousness that in her
was something&mdash;something that he recognised almost
as an old friend&mdash;character, enthusiasm, whatever it
was, that exempted her from ordinary rules. And, as
he chafed against himself for not being able to pass the
whole-hearted condemnation that his fastidiousness
clamoured for, so he doubly chafed against the mystery
in her that imposed so illogical, so unreasonable a
limitation on his judgment, and forced him to feel, in
what all the laws of taste denounced, a monstrous,
fantastic fascination that defied analysis and resistance.</p>

<p>‘So nice,’ he heard Gundred saying; ‘and then you
will go with us to Ivescar, I hope&mdash;our place in Yorkshire.
I have never been there yet, of course, so you
and I will have great fun exploring it&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘Too glorious for words!’ cried Isabel irrelevantly,
her eyes roaming eagerly from wall to wall of the little
low room. ‘I have never dreamt of a fairy-palace
like this. That panelling! Oh, it’s too precious.
And the beautiful dim dustiness of it all! One feels
as if one were trespassing on the domain of ghosts.
These tiny, crazy, oaken parlours&mdash;they must be simply
soaked with memories.’</p>

<p>‘Nice little rooms&mdash;yes?’ said Gundred complacently,
contriving to reprove such undisciplined
enthusiasm by the very gentleness with which she
accepted it. ‘Dusty’ did not seem to her at all a
fitting compliment to pay the oldest wing of Brakelond.
She was certain that the housemaids discharged
their duty perfectly.</p>

<p>‘Nice!’ cried Isabel ardently; ‘what a ridiculous<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
word! They are the haunt of dead centuries. Don’t
you feel either primeval or irreverent every time you
drink a cup of tea here?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no,’ replied Gundred mildly. ‘I hope I should
never have such dreadful feelings anywhere, and the
rooms are really quite convenient. The only thing is
that they are so cut off from the rest of the Castle.
You’ll see to-morrow. This wing stands right away
from the rest of the building, on a spur of rock that
drops straight into the sea. They are all wood, these
rooms&mdash;the oldest part of Brakelond.’</p>

<p>‘I know I thought I had walked miles before we got
here,’ replied Isabel&mdash;‘miles, through the most fascinating
dreadful dark halls and passages, just like the dim
labyrinths in a Maeterlinck Castle.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Gundred; ‘it takes the servants
quite a time to answer the bell; and if one didn’t use
hot irons in the urn it would be cold before it got to
us. And what one would do if anybody fainted or
anything I simply can’t imagine. There is just one
long passage leading to these rooms, and all the servants
are ever so far away in the Georgian part.’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Isabel, ‘you can make this your last
resort. When the Castle is carried by invaders or
catches fire, you can run out here, and shut yourselves
up on your little promontory, and nobody will ever be
able to get at you again.’</p>

<p>‘This wouldn’t be at all a good place if the Castle
took fire,’ said Gundred&mdash;‘built of wood, and no other
way out. But everything is very safe, I am truly
thankful to say. Our great-uncle Henry saw to all
that before he was taken poorly.’</p>

<p>For a moment she was the Mortimer, talking to a
Mortimer, and leaving her husband outside the conversation.
He, for his part, did not notice the recurrence
of that little, proudly conscious yet unconscious<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
inflection in her voice. He was too much absorbed
in watching Isabel. The returned colonial was even
more obviously the daughter of Brakelond than was
Gundred. The vividness of her personality was in
full harmony with the stern old building to which
Gundred’s nature only occasionally chimed in tune.
Isabel was the contemporary of Brakelond. The contrast
between the two women was that between a
jungle and a Dutch garden&mdash;between a passionate,
loose-petalled rose and a decorous, shapely lily. And,
though the lily had its place in the pleasance of Brakelond,
though the Dutch garden might be thrust into
its vast scheme, yet the true frame of the Castle was
the untamable wildness of the forest, its most inevitable
ornament the glowing ardour of the rose. In the long
list of all who had been March and Brakelond here
and there a lily-life occurred, it is true; but the rose,
flaming, riotous, red, must always stand for the fittest
emblem of the Mortimers.</p>

<p>Suddenly Isabel turned upon Kingston, growing
conscious of his attention.</p>

<p>‘Why do you stare at me?’ she asked. ‘Have we
met each other before?’</p>

<p>Kingston doubted; a sense of renewed acquaintance
was very strong upon him. ‘No,’ he replied; ‘we
have never met before. I don’t see how we can ever
have met before.’</p>

<p>‘Surely not, dear&mdash;no?’ added Gundred.</p>

<p>‘I believe,’ said Isabel abruptly, ‘that one has met
everyone in the world before, and that every now and
then one remembers something here and there. Your
husband and I have probably met in a dream, or&mdash;perhaps
we loved or hated each other thousands of
years ago, or our ancestors did, which is the same
thing.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t believe that,’ answered Gundred,<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
gentle, but shocked. ‘That’s evolution, isn’t it? A
horrid idea&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Kingston, meanwhile, with stern loyalty, forced
himself to compare the neat and ladylike blankness
of Gundred’s mind with the uncontrolled wanderings
of her cousin’s. He himself might have much the
same ideas as Isabel, but how much more restful and
proper for a woman to abide by conventional views.
So he denied his own feelings, and disliked more than
ever the untidy apostle who seemed to have a mind
as restless as his own.</p>

<p>Isabel began developing her theme excitedly&mdash;talked
of the innumerable ghosts of Brakelond, of
inherited memories, previous existences, and the impossibility
of supposing that life begins abruptly
at birth and ends at death. No friend, at the best of
times, to abstract discussions, Gundred had the
orderly-minded wife’s intense dislike of such a display
in the mouth of another, and an unmarried, woman.
In a man it was permissible, if regrettable; in a wife
it was reprehensible and unwomanly, though not
utterly unpardonable; but in a mere maiden it was a
dishonour to her sex, a brazen revolution, a discarding
of that spiritual chastity which makes the really nice
girl’s mind a closed and cloistered garden, impossible
of access. Accordingly she made haste to nip the
conversation.</p>

<p>‘You must be so tired,’ said Gundred, rising suddenly
from her chair. ‘I am sure you will be glad to
go to bed&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Isabel was one of the people whom a long journey
animates and inspires. Quite careless as to smuts,
dishevelled locks, and crooked hats, she was at her
best in that weary hour of arrival which makes other
women rush to looking-glasses. However, Gundred’s
tones clearly conveyed the impression that etiquette,<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
if not common politeness, demanded agreement with
her statement. Isabel admitted that she was tired
accordingly, and allowed herself to be guided to her
room.</p>

<p>Kingston and Gundred grew closer thenceforth.
The warmth of their first married days seemed to have
returned. Kingston, in the ardour with which he
regarded his wife, was secretly indemnifying her for
that obstinate folly in his own heart which refused
to condemn the new-comer absolutely. He took
countervailing pains to emphasize his love and admiration
for Gundred. And she, realizing that he
loved her more keenly, thanks to the comparison with
Isabel, yielded to her own heart’s desire, passed from
acquiescence to reciprocation, and was delighted to
find how successfully she emerged from the comparison,
and shone by the side of ragged, reckless Isabel. If
Kingston could not divine, or dared not divine, the
deep current of emotion that underlay his actions, how
much less could such a subtlety be expected of his
wife? She noticed with joy that Isabel was in every
way the foil best calculated to show off her own perfections.
She rejoiced to find that her husband was
as keen-eyed as herself for the edifying contrast, and,
though already conceiving a disapproving distrust of
Isabel, believed so strongly that her presence would
assure the continuation of Kingston’s renewed warmth
that she decided to prolong her cousin’s visit to the
uttermost.</p>

<p>Her motives in making the suggestion were also her
husband’s in accepting them. He was glad to find
himself so appreciating that nice precision of Gundred’s
which he had been beginning to find monotonous;
and, when she suggested that Isabel should
more or less make a home with them till she married,
he let himself believe that her presence would perpetually<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
fire his admiration for Gundred, and fell
gladly in with his wife’s benevolent design.</p>

<p>‘Poor darling,’ said Gundred; ‘she wants forming
so. It will be quite like training a child. I never saw
anyone who was so&mdash;so&mdash;just <em>any</em>how&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘A bit all over the place, certainly. Well, she
couldn’t do better than copy you. And you might
give her a hat or two. But not that one you wore in
the garden this afternoon.’</p>

<p>‘Did you like it, dear?’</p>

<p>‘Most awfully. It made one feel so cool and
summery.’</p>

<p>‘How nice of you to notice my hats, dear! No
other woman’s husband does that.’</p>

<p>‘I always notice everything you wear. Every line
of you, every bow and ribbon. But I can’t always
tell you what I think of you. You won’t often let
me. You hold one at arm’s length, and make one
think one’s self silly and childish. If you knew how
much one loved every detail of you, you wouldn’t
make one feel such a violent ass every time one tries
to express what one feels.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t want to make you feel an idiot, Kingston
darling. It is sweet to hear you say how much
you&mdash;care about me. It seems to make my whole life
seem warm and comfortable. Never leave off feeling
as you do. I think I am always glad to know you feel
like that, and I&mdash;well, I do enjoy hearing you tell me
so from time to time. But in the daylight, somehow,
it seems undignified and&mdash;a little common, to exchange
rhapsodies. And yet I love to think the rhapsodies
are there. And&mdash;don’t you find it makes them more
precious to keep them rare&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>To Kingston a feeling unexpressed was apt, sooner
or later, to degenerate into atrophy. But in the
warmth of the moment he entered into Gundred’s<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
point of view. Her reserves seemed beautiful and
well bred by the side of his deliberate recollection of
Isabel and her leaping, uncontrolled enthusiasms.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you are right, you exquisite thing,’ he
answered. ‘But now and then you ought to let me
speak. I must tell you now and then, in word as well
as in deed, that you are the most exquisite thing in
the world, the most dainty, the most well-finished, the
most adorable thing in the whole world. Altogether
without a fault or a blemish you are, like a clear
polished jewel; one is for ever seeing a fresh facet of
your perfection.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Kingston, you really mustn’t say such things.
It can’t be right. I am sure you are flattering me.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that is your usual answer. You always cut
me short whenever I try to tell you what I feel for you.
You make love seem silly and indecent. You are
always trying to nip it in the bud.’</p>

<p>Gundred hesitated. Then she smiled. ‘Well, Kingston
dear,’ she said, ‘I have not had to nip it in the bud
so often lately&mdash;no? You have not given me the
chance so very often.’</p>

<p>‘One gets tired of being rebuffed and chilled and
made to feel a demonstrative, tiresome fool.’</p>

<p>‘Not tiresome, darling. And, Kingston, whatever
I say, you&mdash;you&mdash;well, you need not always pay <em>quite</em>
so much attention to it, need you? One sometimes
says a thing because one ought to, not because one
means it&mdash;yes? I don’t think I am always quite such
a chilly fish as you seem to imagine. You must not
always judge by what one says. I&mdash;well, I love everything
you say and do, dear. Don’t ever leave off
because you think I don’t approve. I do, Kingston,
whatever I may say&mdash;I approve, because it is you.
Only you must not expect me to say so in the daytime,
with the sun showing up everything, and servants<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
all over the place. I hardly like to say it, even here
in the dark, with nobody to see. It seems to put me
into your power too much.’</p>

<p>‘Into my power! Well, I am in yours. That is
what marriage is. I am between your hands&mdash;between
those wonderful little cool hands of yours, Gundred.
What will you do with me? Crumple me up
and throw me away, or drop me on the rocks, as if I
were a toad? That is what your civilized daytime
manner seems to threaten every now and then. Or
will you keep me safe, and stroke my fur the right way,
and keep me warm?’</p>

<p>‘I like to hear that my stupid hands can do such
wonderful things. Do you really admire my hands,
Kingston dear?’</p>

<p>‘They are just carved ivory fresh from the hands of
God. There is nothing human or hot or earthly about
them. They are fresh and calm, and without spot or
frailty. They are the most lovely hands that ever
woman had.’</p>

<p>‘Prettier than poor Isabel’s&mdash;no?’</p>

<p>‘Poor Isabel? With her hands like a pair of
boxing-gloves? Don’t let us talk about great floppy
Isabel now. It is only you I want to talk about. You
are the only person in the world.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you mustn’t be so unkind about poor Cousin
Isabel,’ protested Gundred, purring with unconscious
pleasure. ‘You must remember she did not make
herself. And think how tiresome it would be if there
were nobody different from me in the whole world. It
takes all sorts to make a world, dear, yes?’</p>

<p>‘No, it doesn’t, wonder-lady. The whole world is
nothing but a huge infinite room of mirrors, reflecting
you, always and everywhere. Hundreds, thousands,
millions of you, that is what I see in the world. How
can I make you believe me?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>To make one’s self believe one’s own statements is,
unfortunately, a far easier task than to make other
people believe them. However, Gundred’s mind
asked nothing better than to be convinced, and the
roseate state of her rapture was far above analysis
and metaphysics.</p>

<p>‘I am sure you would not say such a thing if you did
not mean it, dear,’ she said. ‘It is a beautiful thought
of yours. But you must not grudge poor Isabel a
home with us until she marries. After all, whatever
her shortcomings, poor darling, she <em>is</em> my cousin.
And so it won’t be long before she marries. It’s not as
if she were just nobody in particular.’</p>

<p>Kingston, convinced that the presence of Isabel reinforced
his admiration for Gundred, made no opposition.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ he said, ‘I don’t suppose it will make much
difference to us. She is not the kind of woman who
is likely to come between husband and wife.’ He
laughed.</p>

<p>‘I am certain she is not, poor darling!’ assented
Gundred. ‘We must try to pull her into shape and
teach her better,’ she added, with meditative earnestness,
as if coming between husband and wife were the
especial object of a woman’s life and training. ‘And
yet, I believe there are men who admire that sort of
girl, Kingston. I never can understand a man liking
a woman who cannot put on a hat properly, but everybody
says they do. I remember Mary Capplethwaite;
she was neater than a new pin, with her hair most
beautifully done, and the sweetest little face. But
that did not prevent her husband from running away
with Mildred Gunston, who always looked as if she had
been left out all night in the wind and the rain. Of
course, dear Mary may have got a little monotonous,
but, still, I do think it is a great thing to be tidy and
nice&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>‘That is all a man asks of a woman,’ answered
Kingston. ‘And one might ask it for ever of your
cousin Isabel, and never get it, I imagine. One knows
that type of woman so well. The idea is that inferior
clothes show a superior soul. The poor things believe
that they reveal the beauty, and the freedom, and
the preciousness of their individuality by neglecting
everything that makes the ordinary woman desirable.
They think they are above using the means that no
really clever woman ever disdains. They are the half-baked,
the half-clever, the weak, feeble copies of the
strong-minded, strong-souled creatures they imitate
and think they are. One meets them at Oxford; the
place swarms with them. They sham genius by means
of untidiness. Half of them are tailor-made and half
of them are æsthetic&mdash;in blue plush sleeves and
moulting terra-cotta-coloured plumes, or in short
skirts and boat-shaped hats with a cock’s feather on
one side. How well I know it; and that is your
Cousin Isabel.’</p>

<p>‘You really mustn’t dislike the poor darling so
dreadfully, dear. We must make her happy with
us. But I am so glad that you agree with me about
that kind of woman. I never can see why one’s hair
should not be properly done, however clever one is&mdash;yes?
<em>I</em> have never wanted to be dishevelled or
slovenly. We must gradually get poor Isabel into the
way of thinking about her appearance a little more.
After all, she ought to look at least well-bred, dear, and
even now she has one or two good features.’</p>

<p>But Kingston would not agree. He grew forcible
on the new-comer’s imperfections, and would allow
her no saving grace of line or carriage. She was all
wrong. He insisted on the fact, proved it again and
again, revelled in it, and turned it to the glorification
of his wife. Gundred, for her part, made a weak<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
defence; without quite knowing it, she drew joy and
sustenance from her husband’s condemnation of her
cousin. It seemed an earnest of his love’s ardour.
So she merely palliated Isabel’s faults, and was more
glad to challenge admiration for herself by their discovery
than sorry that such blemishes should be
brought to light. Sweetly and lovingly did she encourage
her husband’s criticisms with her mild protests.
Her line was to admit her cousin’s shortcomings,
but to declare that she loved her notwithstanding.
Thus she preserved the full delight of the comparison,
while at the same time preserving also the proper
loyalty of a Mortimer for a Mortimer. But her daylight
dignity had melted; the loyalty of a Mortimer was felt
to be now subordinate to that of a wife. Gundred had
the happy power of making a virtue of everything she
did, no matter what inconsistencies her actions might
seem to involve. Husband and wife continued to
make love over the faults of their cousin, and it was
decided with joy that the woman whose weaknesses
could be turned to such delectable account must on no
account be allowed to deprive them of her company.
Isabel was to live with them, to go with them to Ivescar,
to serve as a perpetual whetstone for Kingston’s admiration
of Gundred. Some day she would undoubtedly
marry, but meanwhile Gundred’s kindness should
achieve the double end of giving her cousin a home and
turning her cousin’s existence to a profitable purpose.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>


<p>The next morning Isabel was as late as Kingston.
Gundred condoned the offence on the score of fatigue,
but Kingston regarded it with that severity we always
show to our own pet faults when we meet them in<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
people we dislike. Daylight added nothing and softened
nothing in his first impressions as to his wife’s
cousin. Still untidy, still disorderly, still ebullient,
Isabel was as reprehensible as ever in all she did and
said, and Kingston’s irritation grew as he noticed how
often she said what he would have said himself, how
she caught his own flying thoughts while Gundred’s
mind was still loitering in their track, or busy with the
teapot; how unable his instinct still was to endorse the
opinion of his reason that Isabel was altogether unworthy
of notice. Without seeming to, without caring
to, she claimed his notice, insisted on it, held it; and
as the day went by, he found himself looking at her
again and again with reluctant interest. Each time
he forced himself to notice a loose strand of hair, a
brooch unfastened, a hook and eye gone wrong; but
not the most strenuous disapproval of details could
kill his angry curiosity as to the personality of which
they made part. As she talked, her wide mouth, with
its scarlet lips, flickered and flashed at every feeling,
and her great eyes blazed at him, now green, now grey,
now gold, till the white was visible all round, and he felt
himself bound in the magnetism of their stare. Isabel
had accepted Gundred’s proposal with equanimity.
Yes, she would make a part of their household gladly,
until such time, she said, as she married or eloped.
What Gundred had meant&mdash;at least, in part&mdash;as a
favour done to the poor colonial cousin, the poor
colonial cousin accepted with the high calm of perfect
equality, easily, gracefully, and without a second
thought or any emphasis of gratitude. Gundred felt
that her cousin’s manner of receiving favours lacked
something; she made them seem mere services; and
her words, too, sounded flippant and offhand to
Gundred, who clung to small politenesses and the proper
observances of courtesy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>They were sitting out, all three, in the small square
garden. The day was sultry and mysterious, with
curling heavy masses of white and fawn-coloured cloud
towering high over the rim of a pallid sea. Behind,
the mass of the Castle was of a bronzy-rose in the strange
light, dreamlike and splendid. In bed and border no
flower stirred, and the scent of roses rose straight into
the leaden air like so many spires of faint invisible smoke.
They sat looking out towards the edge of the world,
the unwavering dim line of water that stretched beyond
the old wing of King Mark’s Chapel. Above all the
rest of the Castle Isabel loved to look at that old haphazard
rickle of rooms, that crazy hive of long-dead
activities, which stood out from the rest of the building
on its defiant promontory over the sea. It was a little
barnacle, growing off the hulk of Brakelond, and attached
only by the slender stalk of one narrow passage, at
whose outer end was its cluster of buildings, the low
squat chapel, then the rooms where Kingston, Gundred,
and Isabel had their dwelling, and, above, a second
story, a series of low rooms at present uninhabited.</p>

<p>‘Ivescar?’ said Isabel. ‘Ivescar&mdash;oh yes, thank
you very much, Gundred. I shall be ever so pleased
to go to Ivescar. Oh, those little rooms of ours are
too delicious for words. And there’s no ivy too; that
would make them conventional. I love them. I
don’t think the Castle does, though. They seem too
proud to belong to it. They keep themselves to themselves.
The ghosts are happier there than in the big
tower. My room was simply crammed with them,
Gundred. All last night they hovered about.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t say so!’ exclaimed Gundred. ‘How
dreadfully inconvenient! I do hope they did not keep
you awake, dear. Do you really believe in them?
Surely not&mdash;no? One believes that God would never
allow such things. Anyhow, we must be very careful<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
not to let the servants hear about them, or all the housemaids
will be giving notice. But I was talking about
Ivescar. We thought of going there in quite a few
days now. The summer is getting on, and Kingston
wants to show me to all our people there&mdash;tenants and
so forth. One feels it rather one’s duty&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘Ivescar?’ repeated Isabel; ‘I don’t think I am
very much interested in Ivescar, am I? Of course, I
am looking forward to going there. But it cannot be
anything like this. And I belong here. I am sure I
do. It is not anything like this, Gundred?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, dear me, no, of course not. There isn’t anything
like this anywhere. Ivescar is just a nice modern
place, large and comfortable, but quite modern. I
haven’t been there yet, but Kingston has told me all
about it. His father bought it, estate and all, when
he married&mdash;didn’t he, Kingston?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied her husband; ‘he chose a county as far
away as possible from all his own people in Kent.
They quarrelled with him when he married, and now
none of them will have anything to do with us. So he
thought when it came to settling down as a landed proprietor
and all the rest of it&mdash;my mother’s pet fancy,
that was&mdash;that he would go right away to the other
corner of England. So now our own family, the
Dadds, are still sitting in Darnley-on-Downe, watching
the coal-pits that support the head of the clan at the
other end of the country. It is a quaint irony.’</p>

<p>‘Haven’t you any exciting possibilities among your
relations?’ asked Isabel, turning to him. ‘They sound
a little stodgy, to say nothing of the fact that they have
all cut you.’</p>

<p>‘Well, there is a mystery, I believe. An uncle, a
brother of my father’s, who ran away to Japan, and is
now a Buddhist Abbot or Bishop, or something of the
kind. But for all the excitement one is ever likely to<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
get out of him, he might as well never have been born.
He is twelve thousand miles away, and we shall probably
never set eyes on him again.’</p>

<p>Gundred looked a little pained, and made haste to
divert the conversation from this irreligious topic, just
as Isabel was about to burst out into enthusiastic
curiosity.</p>

<p>‘So Mr. Darnley bought this delightful estate in
Yorkshire, and there is no use thinking of unpleasant
things in the past. Nothing could sound nicer than
Ivescar. Describe it, Kingston.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, it sits right up among the fells and moors,
just under one of the big mountains, in a tiny little
bare glen all of its own. It is a stern, splendid country,
very large and stiff and barren, up at Ivescar, and then,
down below, there is a great fat valley, all smooth and
smiling, that rolls away westward to the sea. There
are jolly rivers and waterfalls all about in the hills, too,
and wonderful caves and crevasses and pitfalls. It’s
quite unlike anything else in England, and it grows on
one in the most extraordinary way. There is something
very primeval and mysterious about it.’</p>

<p>‘And capital shooting,’ added Gundred. ‘Such
nice moors, they tell me, Isabel. We will go up and
have lunch with the guns as often as we can&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, the moors are gorgeous,’ said Kingston. ‘I
don’t shoot myself; I have given it up. But the moors
are certainly gorgeous. One can lose one’s self on
them for hours, and probably fall into potholes and
things.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you must take up your shooting again, dear,’
protested Gundred, who had the usual tender-hearted
woman’s ambition that her husband should destroy
innocent lives as lavishly and enthusiastically and successfully
as fashion demands. ‘You must certainly
take it up again. I do think it such a good thing for a<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
man to have some interest in life, don’t you, Isabel&mdash;something
for him to do in the country&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Isabel abruptly let this uninteresting development of
the conversation lapse unanswered.</p>

<p>‘The country does sound attractive,’ she conceded,
turning eager eyes on Kingston. ‘And you talk of it
as if you belonged there. But you don’t, of course.’</p>

<p>‘No, but my dear mother has spent so many years
pretending to that the pretence is second nature by
now. Dear mother! it used to be the funniest thing in
the world to see her playing at the Old Established
Family. It was her great ambition, and she drilled
my poor father day and night into acting the squire.
By now I verily believe she has persuaded herself
that we have been settled at Ivescar for half a dozen
centuries at least. She goes about among the tenants
with the most splendid air of having known them all,
and all their families, since the days of Edward the
Confessor. There’s nothing so genuine as a good
imitation&mdash;except that the good imitation is generally
too good, and overdoes itself.’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Isabel, ‘you have fired me with a longing
for the mountains and the caves and waterfalls. But
what is the house itself like?’</p>

<p>At this point Gundred caught them up again. She
had dropped out of the dialogue in a twinge of decorous
annoyance at the cavalier way in which Isabel had
ignored her opening on sport and shelved the conversation.</p>

<p>‘A very nice house, Kingston tells me,’ she put in.
‘Built about a hundred years ago. Very comfortable
and convenient.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, I know,’ interrupted Isabel. ‘That tells me
everything. All of the best Early-Victorian Tudor.
Everything solid and handsome and expensive, with a
picture of your husband’s father in the hall, life-size,<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
carrying a gun and a dead rabbit. I can imagine
Ivescar&mdash;just a house&mdash;just a thing with doors and
roofs and windows&mdash;simply a place to live in. Now,
this, this’&mdash;she waved her hands comprehensively&mdash;‘this
isn’t a place to live in. It’s a place that lives on
people. Here it’s the people that are subordinate to
the building. At Ivescar nobody cares about the
house except for the people. The house only exists to
keep their feet warm, and send them up their dinner all
cosy and hot from the kitchen. Yes, Ivescar is a place
to live in, and this is a place to die in. One can’t
imagine one’s self dying in an ordinary house. Death
is too big a thing to come under its nice squatty ceilings.
One feels the whole thing would fly in flinders; Death
would lift the roof off, and burst the walls, if he came in.
He is so large. But one could die here, and the setting
would not be a bit mean or unsuited to the drama.
Any nice, carpety, cushiony building does to live in;
one wants a really-truly house to die in&mdash;a place where
one can receive the Great Visitor without feeling
cramped or undignified or cheap. Imagine dying in a
chintz bedroom, with enamelled tin baths and foot-pans
and hot-water cans.’</p>

<p>‘Lots of people do,’ protested Kingston. ‘I suppose
they have the Elizabethan feeling that the play is more
important than its setting.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but they don’t die at all,’ cried Isabel. ‘Very
few people are great and holy enough to die. Nine
people out of ten just change shapes and go on again.
You can tell that by the fuss they make. One always
fusses more when one harries about at a junction than
when one arrives at a terminus. Most people, when
they come to die, are simply getting out of one train
and into another on their journey. Arriving at the end
is a much more simple solemn business. That is
what I mean by dying. And for that one needs a<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
splendid stage. It is a far leap into Nirvana, and if
one is to make it, one wants a good take-off, a running
jump from a strong springy board, with nothing to
trammel one and lessen one’s movements. To hop
along into another mean little manifestation, as most
people do, requires very little outside help. It is hardly
more than a shuffle from one bed to another. One
does not want any spring-board for that.’</p>

<p>‘I expect,’ said Kingston, ‘that a vast number of
quiet good people reach Nirvana without big jumps
or spring-boards, or anything of the sort. They go
on living obscure, kindly lives, and then, at the end of
everything, they just gently slip away and cease, and
enter Nirvana without any splash at all.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, those are the people who go on the great journey
without luggage. But the average person takes any
amount of packages and parcels with him, all kinds of
fears and fusses and hopes and terrors. And the reason
why he makes such a to-do whenever he has to change
trains or carriages is because he is so afraid he may
leave one of the precious bundles behind. He thinks
they are his individuality, just as a decent woman
thinks that her clothes are hers. In fact, scarcely
anyone can conceive an idea of himself without his
trappings. And so, all along the Great Railway, you
have people wailing and shrinking at the thought of
death. They know, in their heart of hearts, that at
each change they leave one or two of the bundles behind&mdash;a
fear or a hate or a habit&mdash;and they cannot understand
that they can continue to be themselves without
the bundles. They think, as I said, that the bundles
are an essential part of themselves; whereas it is not
till one has gradually shed all one’s bundles that one
can hope to arrive, one’s own real unhampered self,
at the Terminus. It is only the Self that is meant to
arrive, not the bundles. They are the common property<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
of all, like clothes and rugs and umbrellas, but
each man’s self is a lone, isolated thing.’</p>

<p>She spoke with her usual fire, urgently, with hands
lavishly waved, and blazing eyes. Gundred, quite out
of the talk, left behind in the lower world, looked on
with bewildered disapproval.</p>

<p>‘Travelling is a great trouble&mdash;yes?’ she hazarded.
‘I always have as little luggage as possible.’</p>

<p>Kingston dropped back into Gundred’s world with a
crash. He had been interested and uplifted on the
wings of his cousin’s fantasies. He could meet her
flying in that empyrean of ideas. He loved the vague,
dim regions of her thought. Gundred, without clipping
his wings, kept him tethered to her own perch.
Happily she clucked and hopped with him in the
glittering cage&mdash;a hen-soul yoked with a restless
hawk’s. Now, out of the free air beyond, had appeared
a second hawk, and insensibly Kingston’s wings began
to flutter uneasily for a flight.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he said rather savagely, answering an unspoken
question. ‘No wonder poor Gundred can’t
understand such mists and inanities. Have you any
idea what you mean, Isabel?’</p>

<p>His irritation was all against Gundred’s inadequacy.
It showed her almost in an inferior light. Characteristically,
though, he diverted his annoyance to the score
of his cousin’s mysticism, and unburdened on her the
feelings that his wife had engendered.</p>

<p>‘Idea?’ replied Isabel scornfully. ‘No; why should
I? If anyone ever stopped to think what their words
really meant, and refused to speak until they had found
out, why, no one would ever open their lips again.
Man sends the words, and Heaven, we trust, sends the
meaning. I have vague notions of a meaning very far
away above and beyond all the harassing futilities of
language, beyond the domain of grammar and derivations<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
and split infinitives and metaphors and things.
But of course one can’t hit it; one can only aim at it.
One shoots off into the clouds in the hope of sometimes
winging a truth. There’s no use sitting and aiming,
aiming, aiming; one has to up with the gun of one’s
mind and blaze away. Nine times out of ten one misses
dead, but bit by bit one gets practice, just as in earthly
shooting, until at last one has attained a good average
level of success, though I am afraid till the end of
the chapter one only wings Truth, never gets it fair
and square in the heart.’</p>

<p>‘Shall we go in and have tea&mdash;yes?’ said Gundred,
with gentle dignity, into which was mixed a fine proportion
of reproof. She rose and moved towards the
door. Isabel looked after her.</p>

<p>‘I have shocked Gundred,’ she said candidly and
callously. ‘I suppose I was bound to. She is too fascinating
and pretty for words, but I don’t feel, somehow,
as if her soul and mine were really cousins. I’m sorry
if I have hurt her. It is all my fault. One is such a
fool. One gets interested in an idea, and off one goes
at score, and nothing else matters in the world but the
hunting of it down. You are like that, too, though you
are pretending hard not to be. Why do you? Are
you trying to match Gundred? You’ll never be able
to, you know.’</p>

<p>She looked up at him, laughing. Her face had a
radiant, exasperating vitality. In that moment he
disliked her more even for what she had than for what
she lacked.</p>

<p>‘Don’t see how you can possibly tell that,’ he said,
standing over her, with his hand on the back of his wife’s
chair; ‘and I don’t see that it matters&mdash;to you, at
all events.’</p>

<p>‘A perfect match,’ continued Isabel, pursuing her
thought with no attention to Kingston&mdash;‘a perfect<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
match&mdash;I suppose it is when neither husband nor wife
is a match for the other. No, it doesn’t matter a bit.
Only I am interested. I always am. I have only just
arrived from the back of beyond, and yet I feel as if I
had known you both&mdash;known you, at least, for half a
dozen centuries. I can see all sorts of odd things in
your mind&mdash;things that you have no idea of. You are
quite naked to me as I look at you.’</p>

<p>Kingston conceived an instant red desire to shake
and maltreat this insolent barbarian.</p>

<p>‘Are you coming in to tea?’ he asked, turning
away as if to leave her.</p>

<p>Isabel sat up in the long garden chair in which she
had been lounging.</p>

<p>‘Stop,’ she said.</p>

<p>Angrily, against his will, he stopped and turned
towards her. Her voice compelled him. Unknown
voices were answering her in his heart.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ he asked, trying to mitigate the animosity
that surged within him, no less at her demeanour than
at the power she exerted.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be so angry with me,’ she replied; ‘or don’t
be angrier than you can help. I am a moral hooligan;
I am quite irresponsible. So you need not think me
more odious than I am. Honestly I mean no harm.
But one must amuse one’s self.’</p>

<p>‘Necessarily by annoying everyone else?’ asked
Kingston as amiably as he could.</p>

<p>‘I don’t mean to,’ said Isabel; ‘nobody ever cared
less about annoying people than I do.’ She rose
swiftly, with a certain lithe splendour of movement.
‘Listen,’ she said in a new voice of seriousness, her
eyes on a level with his: ‘I have an impulse. I will
tell you the truth, as far as I can. Perhaps you think
that what I say and do is simply bad manners and
sheer native offensiveness. It isn’t that. It is that I<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
don’t care&mdash;neither what happens, nor what I say, nor
what anyone else in all the world may say or think or
do. I don’t care a damn. Not a single solitary. I
never have. And, of course, that simplifies conduct
immensely, though I admit it may make one a little
trying to live with at times. Do you understand?’</p>

<p>She spoke calmly, indifferently. But in every word
she spoke he could hear the note of a perfect pride, of a
pride so intense as to be quite careless, quite impersonal,
quite unself-conscious. It was true that she did not
care. But her indifference was based on no obtrusive
conceit, on no selfish ill-breeding, no instinct for flamboyance
and advertisement. It was the deep base of
her nature, a serene impermeability to other people’s
opinion, and Gundred had something of the same
quality; but Gundred was indifferent because her
pride made her feel superior to all the world. The
pride of Isabel was that higher, more terrific pride which
leaps beyond a mere comparison of one’s self with
others, and is simply an all-absorbing sense of individuality.
Whether Isabel was superior to others she
never cared to stop and consider; all she cared for was
the thought that she was she and they were they.
The comparison was still there, but implicit, subconscious,
tacit. Her personality defied criticism by
ignoring it. Kingston suddenly found the serene
audacity of her attitude a challenge to his interest.</p>

<p>To wake feeling in such a Stylites of egoism, to win her
praise or her condemnation, would be a task more
piquant to a professed emotionalist than any seduction
to a sensualist. To seduce the mind of Isabel, to draw
it down from its heights, and force it to feel, fear, or
hate&mdash;at least, to abandon its indifferentism, there was
a test of skill. Had the indifference been a pose, the
task would have been cheap, lacking in adventure.
That it was mere undecorated nature was at once the<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
defender’s great strength and the besieger’s strong
attraction. It challenged arrogantly, irresistibly. Then
Kingston remembered how much he disliked his cousin,
and refused to hear the call. Strenuously he shut his
ears to it, and gave her appeal a colourless answer.</p>

<p>‘In some ways,’ he said, ‘I suppose it is as well not
to care what people think or say. But the position is
always an ungraceful one, and is certain ruin to one’s
hopes of popularity. However, if you don’t care, of
course, popularity does not matter to you, either one
way or the other.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Isabel; ‘one demands it, and expects it.
And if one doesn’t get it as one’s right, one refuses to
accept it as anyone’s favour. And obviously the lack
of it can make no real difference. How can unpopularity
affect one’s opinion of one’s self? And that is
the only thing in the world that really does matter.
By that alone one rises or falls, is glorified or condemned.’
She spoke quietly and carelessly, as much to
herself as to him or the world at large. Just so, in
such cool, insolently indifferent tones might Queen
Isabel have discussed her own attitude from a dispassionate
external point of view.</p>

<p>‘Incidentally,’ replied Kingston, ‘one runs the risk
of giving any amount of pain to any number of inoffensive
people.’</p>

<p>‘Now you are trying to make me feel a brute,’
answered Isabel. ‘But it is no good. If they are hurt,
it is their own fault. Pain always implies some weakness
in the person who suffers it. And you can’t
make one person responsible for the inherent weaknesses
of another, just because his action has stirred
certain hidden symptoms to life. You might just as
well scold me if I gave a tea-party, and somebody with
advanced consumption got a cold at it, and died off.
The disease was in him, not in me or my tea-party.<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
And moral suffering is the symptom of a sort of moral
phthisis. Only the diseased can suffer. So, as long as
my actions are sane and healthy in themselves, you
must not call them names if they happen to stumble
on weak spots and corns in other people’s natures. I
never knew the corns were there. I simply went my
way. Everyone has a right to. Everyone must.
And one is only responsible to one’s self, and only responsible
for one’s self. So much for your accusation
of hurting other people.’</p>

<p>‘I never heard anything so callous in my life. If
you were as bad as your words you would be a
perfect fiend. But, mercifully, everyone in the world
is better than their words, and worse than their
thoughts.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! you are a sentimentalist, Kingston. I am a
realist.’</p>

<p>‘Everyone thinks himself that. The only difference
between the sentimentalist and the realist is that the
sentimentalist’s reality is warm and beautiful, while
the realist’s is glacial and hideous. And they are
neither of them real realities, either. The real reality has
something of both, and a great deal more than either
or both together. Each view is only a glimpse of the
great whole.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; that’s not a bad idea. However old one may
grow or think one’s self, one remains astonishingly
much of a baby in the face of the immensities. I suppose
to take any point of view is childish. One ought
to take them all together, all at once&mdash;be a drunkard
and a teetotaler and a bishop and a butcher and a
thief and a saint all at one moment in one’s own person.
That is the only way to get the perfect knowledge.
And that, I suppose, is what the idea of God
is. To understand everything by being everything.
However, as that is so, I don’t think one need be<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
ashamed of being a baby with lop-sided, partial,
babyish views and fanaticisms.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not. But you seemed to be proud of it.
There is a great difference between being proud and
not being ashamed.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Kingston, there is. And I admit it. And I
give in. And I am defeated. And I want my tea.
And I will try to behave prettily. And be an altruist
with the tea-cake instead of an individualist.’</p>

<p>Concessions occasionally mollify. But Isabel made
hers so abruptly, so flippantly that it seemed as if she
threw up the battle not conscientiously, but because she
no longer thought it worth the trouble of fighting.
Irritation swept over Kingston at being thus cheated
like a child&mdash;played with, flouted, and put by as soon
as the game had begun to weary the older player. His
little victory lost all its satisfaction. He attributed
his exasperation entirely to the impudent frivolity of
Isabel and not at all to any underlying eagerness and
enjoyment that he might have been beginning to develop
in the dialogue. Outraged reasonableness swelled
his demeanour as he turned in silence and led the way
towards the Castle. Suddenly he felt a hand on his
arm.</p>

<p>‘Do be friends,’ said Isabel softly and earnestly.
‘We have been friends for such ages in the past, I
expect, that it would be a pity to begin badly in the
present. I am only a barbarian, not a venomous
toad. So do be friends.’</p>

<p>‘Do you really want to be?’ asked Kingston
abruptly.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Isabel&mdash;‘yes,’ she repeated slowly, as if
surprised at herself.</p>

<p>‘Soberly and seriously?’ inquired her cousin. ‘I
mean, is it a thing you honestly want? I thought you
cared about nobody’s opinion.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<p>‘I didn’t,’ she answered, ‘and I don’t. And yet
just this I do care for. I want you to be friends with
me. In my heart I am friends with you already&mdash;greater
friends than I could ever have believed. Why
should I be, why should I want to be? I have no
idea. Well, what do you say?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, if you will,’ replied Kingston. ‘Why shouldn’t
we be friends? We count as cousins.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t like me yet, of course,’ said Isabel
calmly. ‘But, then, nobody does at first. All I
want is that you shouldn’t be hostile and stick out
bristles and resist. The rest will come.’</p>

<p>Kingston’s consciousness was in a whirl. He knew
that he thoroughly disliked this saucer-eyed, eager
creature. Everything she said and did aroused in him
pulses of animosity so keen as to be almost physical.
On the other hand, in some strange way, she allured,
fascinated, excited him. She led his instincts captive,
while his judgment went charging down upon her undaunted.
Irritating though she might be, she was
neither stodgy nor boring. His mind seemed to pringle
under her influence, fiercely yet thrillingly, like a
numb, constricted limb awakening from its sleep.
Compared to Gundred, she was as brandy to milk.
Of course Kingston loved the milk and loathed the
brandy. But loathsome though it might be, he could
not deny that the brandy was more potent, more
stirring, more exciting than the milk. Since the
brandy was forcing itself into his cup, there was no
need to throw it roughly away; he might sip, under
protest, now and then, without danger of contracting
any disloyal craving for brandy instead of milk.</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ he said; ‘let us be friends, Isabel.
One can’t control one’s love or liking. But everything
comes to those who wait. So we will be friends.’</p>

<p>His candour pleased her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>‘Control?’ she said. ‘Our feelings control <em>us</em>, if
they are real feelings. The only real feelings are those
that are uncontrollable.’</p>

<p>‘I am the son of many generations of unreal feelings
then. There are no love stories in my quiet family&mdash;at
least, only one, and that was a mad freak.’</p>

<p>‘There are no others in mine,’ said Isabel, ‘except
hate stories, perhaps. And I suppose they are the
same thing, only turned wrong way out.’</p>

<p>‘I believe that real love is quite calm and level, you
know,’ explained Kingston. ‘Your great blazing stories
are built of passion, not of love. A big love is very
quiet, and goes on peacefully from day to day, almost
monotonous in its imperceptible development.’</p>

<p>‘It sounds too like the kingdom of heaven to be very
satisfactory on earth,’ said Isabel.</p>

<p>‘Anyhow,’ replied Kingston, hotly defending what
nobody had attacked; ‘I say that the happy concert
of lives and marriages&mdash;ideal lives and marriages&mdash;is
based on tranquil harmonies, not on melodramatic
chords.’</p>

<p>Isabel smiled quietly. ‘Why are we talking about
love?’ she asked. ‘It was friendship we were settling
on.’</p>

<p>He made no reply, and they entered the Castle.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>


<p>The friendship between Kingston and Isabel did not
progress apace. Its development was jerky, uneven,
unsatisfactory. Kingston was at once restrained and
spurred on by resentment. He resented the fact of
the friendship, was perpetually reluctant, suspicious,
filled with a strange, alert uneasiness. Isabel, for her
part, found the relation less careless and smooth than<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
her friendships usually were. It brought an usually
poignant satisfaction, and, in revenge, an unusually
poignant feeling of strain and annoyance at Kingston’s
refusal to meet her half-way. Normally she should not
have cared a straw&mdash;by all her rules she did not care
a straw&mdash;yet, none the less, the guarded hostility with
which he met her advances stimulated and exasperated
her to the point of defiance.</p>

<p>The two women did not find, as their acquaintance
grew, that any intimacy ripened between them.
Gundred retained her desire to keep Isabel by her side
as a foil, but not even the ardour that the contrast was
to keep alive in Kingston could quite reconcile her to
the mental eccentricities and untidinesses of Isabel.
In Gundred’s mind nothing was ever disorderly or
misplaced; second-hand ideas lay neatly labelled in
rows; the chaos of Isabel’s thoughts, her incessant
flurry of pursuit after some wild notion or other, her
ransackings of her intellectual store to find some lost
fancy, to run down some far-fetched theory, were so
many evidences, to Gundred, of her cousin’s unmethodical,
ill-balanced nature. All thought, to Gundred,
was clear, simple, obvious; she never entertained
any opinion that had not been sanctioned by fashion
and much previous use; she could not imagine why
anyone should accept new notions, much less go wild-goose-chasing
them up and down the cloudy domain
of ideas. What had been thought before by wise,
good teachers was quite good enough for her; to want
more, to ask questions, to test ‘truths’ by reason,
seemed forward, ill-bred, and unwomanly. She put
down all Isabel’s vagaries of mind to her disastrous
colonial education, and believed at first that a few
weeks’ association with ‘nice people’&mdash;the nice people
being, in the context, herself&mdash;would cure her cousin
of such vagabond tendencies. So by smiles and indifference<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
she repressed Isabel’s ebullitions; and when
she found that her conduct had no effect beyond
excluding herself from the conversation, she resigned
herself calmly to the inevitable.</p>

<p>Irritated at first by Isabel’s mental jumps and
flights, Gundred, after her attempts at repression had
failed, grew tired and bored, made no effort to follow
her cousin’s mental movements, and, with a mildly
reproving air which nobody noticed, stood graciously
aloof from Isabel’s dialogues with Kingston. She
let them talk, and, by way of tacitly rebuking her
cousin, ostentatiously ceased to take any interest in
what they said.</p>

<p>With Kingston, as was inevitable, this course insensibly
began to shift her relationship. As the days
went by, he talked more and more to Isabel, until by
degrees she became insensibly the target for everything
he said. Imperceptibly he grew to ignore his wife,
thanks to the attitude that she assumed. However,
she was perfectly, increasingly happy. For, as his
intellectual intimacy with Isabel advanced, he grew
more and more the warm lover of his wife. And she,
the apparently cold and ethereal, by the irony of her
own limitations, came at last to base the triumph of
her wifehood on the strength of her husband’s embraces.
His raptures, his compliments, his kisses,
grew in number and ardour; she had her heart’s desire.
No thought of jealousy could ever have approached her;
for intellectual intimacy she had no taste, no wish.
As long as she had Kingston’s arms, Isabel was perfectly
welcome to a monopoly of his tongue. She,
Gundred, was his wife, and nothing could alter the
glory of that. She triumphed in the successful development
of their relations.</p>

<p>That men like to chatter and overflow and sweat off
in talk the superfluous energy of their minds she knew<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
to be an accepted fact. Some women are born for men
to talk to, but the ultimate triumph belongs to the wife,
the woman who orders the man’s dinner, sees to his
comforts, has him for her property at bed and board.
As long as his body remains faithful and loyal, who
cares where his undisciplined mind may go roving from
hour to hour? So Gundred was glad to compound for
Kingston’s increasing affection by welcoming the distractions
in which his mind indulged, and even, in the
rare moments when she could divert her attention from
her own bliss, was vaguely sorry for Isabel, reduced to
so poor and undignified a rôle as that of wash-pot to
the intellectual offscourings of a married man. But
Isabel, after all, had brought the humiliation on herself,
and Gundred soon returned to the contemplation of the
mastery which she had established over her husband’s
affection by providing him with someone to talk to.
Wifely tact, she felt, had been splendidly justified.
She never stopped to consider that the means by which
she had achieved her end in themselves betrayed the
disastrous weakness of her position. Her idea of
temptation was limited to physical allurements;
husbands, she knew, were only led away by bad, beautiful
women, never by untidy, talkative ones. Her
position was absolutely safe and dominant; the more
freely her husband’s mind was allowed to wander and
kick up its heels, the more securely was her husband’s
body bound in the bonds of its allegiance. Infidelity
is only a matter of the flesh. Without physical desire
there can be no adultery.</p>

<p>So passed the remaining days of their stay at Brakelond.
Then the three removed to Ivescar, and, with
the setting, the colour of the whole drama changed.
Human life and death was the keynote of Brakelond;
its Castle seemed built and mortared with the tears and
tragedies of innumerable generations. Every stone was<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
permeated with the history of ten thousand men and
women, who, through eight centuries, had brought to
bear upon the building the fire and fury of their individual
existences. Outside the walls rolled down the
skirt of forest, and below lay the sea; but forest and sea
were subordinate in the scheme, decorations and embroideries
on the main theme. And the main theme
was the incessant human note that resounded in every
detail of the old tragic Castle.</p>

<p>At Ivescar, on the other hand, man was a new-comer,
an accident, a thing irrelevant and even incongruous.
High up in its narrow mountain-valley
lay the house, amid a plantation of stunted, wind-swept
pines. It had the air of having been put there,
not of having grown. Brakelond had sprung and
waxed from the rock it stood on; it was the last crowning
development of the land it dominated. Ivescar was
an artificial product, unrelated to the soil, the work of
alien brains and alien natures. Twenty centuries
might pass over it without bringing it into any closer
kindred with its surroundings, without softening the
raw, crude note of novelty that it would always strike
among the solemn eternal hills. It was a large sandstone
building, of the most solid Early-Victorian Tudor
design, as Isabel’s instinct had foretold. In the middle
rose a big square tower, finished off with a stone lacework
of circles and spikes. It had a flagstaff, a cupola
with a bell in it, and a huge conservatory that had
been put there because it was expensive to set up, and
now remained there because it would be expensive to
remove. On three sides of it stretched a bare lawn,
and on the fourth its less honourable quarters were
shrouded in sparse plantation, created at great outlay,
with much difficulty and no success. The one level
space of ground in the glen had been picked out, all
its irregularities trimmed away, and the pretence of a<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
park elaborately maintained under the mountain-slopes
that rose stark and stern on either side. A
little river struggled down from the end of the valley,
and found its way among stones and mosses through
the young woodland. Where it passed within sight of
the house, at the other side of the flat lawn, it had been
civilized and sedulously constrained into decorum.
Its banks had been widened, made uniform and flat.
Dammed at one end, it had been made to stretch out
into a square shallow lake, whose grey and steely surface
reflected the staring yellow of the house against
the grey hills and sky behind, with a dreariness impossible
to conceive. Coarse, rank grasses grew along
its margin, and its shoals, malodorous and muddy,
were abristle with melancholy rushes.</p>

<p>Behind and on either side of Ivescar rose the fells&mdash;steep
slopes of grass and scree, carrying up to the white
precipices that hemmed the little valley in. High
above these again, but out of sight, rose the mass of the
great mountains, each standing on its plinth of limestone.
Here and there the line of a wall betrayed
the existence of humanity, but otherwise, except for
the house in its artificial wood, with its artificial lawn
and lake, the landscape utterly ignored the world of
men. It was grand, primeval, solitary, remote from
all the small mortal concerns of life. As it had been
since the dawn of history, so it remained to-day.
Peoples had come and gone, dynasties towered and
crashed; but the little glen under the shadow of the
Simonstone had wrought out its own fate untroubled
by the clatter and tinkle of collapsing empires. Silent
and serene as it stood, the finger of man had never
scarred its tranquillity, the voice of man had never
broken into the current of its dream. And yet, in the
midst of this immortal solitude, the fancy of a rich
manufacturer had planted this insolent mushroom of a<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
house, this brazen assertion of a fact which the hills
had always chosen to ignore, though Celt and Saxon,
Dane and Norman had vainly striven to enforce it on
their consciousness, as they fought out their ephemeral
fights across the flanks of Ravensber, or made their
settlement on the flat crown of the Simonstone. The
valley and the mountains had taken their unruffled
course. Had the house been less clamorous, the assault
on their notice less insistent, they might in time have
come to assimilate the signs and the presence of man. A
quieter dwelling might insensibly have melted into their
scheme, have been merged into the vast individuality of
the hills. But Ivescar was too flaunting, too blatant, too
eternally new. It compelled attention, was an unceasing
penny-whistle across the great harmony of silence.
And so, unable to make Ivescar one with themselves,
the mountains took the only other course, refusing all
compromise, and forced the incongruity of the building
upon the world’s notice, by the blank contempt
with which they ignored it. Their unnoticing disdain
made its yellow stones, its pretentious tower appear
even more undignified than ever, emphasizing every
detail of their parvenu richness, their uneasy vulgarity.
Man at Brakelond was the dominant note of Castle and
country; here the note was an isolated discord. Man
was nothing, his works an offence, amid the enormous
loneliness of the fells.</p>

<p>Gundred, however, found herself warmly approving
of Ivescar. True, the country just round was “dreadfully
black and barren, very ugly and uncultivated”;
but the house was roomy, airy, warm, comfortable,
quite suitable and pleasant in every way. It would
hold plenty of people, and had been built with an eye
to the convenience of house-parties. Carpets and
curtains and cushions were all opulent and softly
luxurious. They compared well, to her taste, with the<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
bare floors, the flags, the worn matting of Brakelond.
She resolved on a few improvements, but, on the whole,
was very well satisfied. A building produced by one
mind may, perhaps, have a less complicated personality,
a simpler sense of unity, than one built up by the
varying tastes of twenty succeeding generations.
Ivescar was plain and direct in scheme. There was a
good collection of pictures, bought, all together, by
James Darnley from the previous owner, who had
accumulated them because he imagined it a suitable
thing to do; otherwise Ivescar was tormented
by no ambitions whatever, artistic or dramatic. It
only aimed, with a good-humoured whole-heartedness,
at being altogether comfortable. Gundred
entered into its spirit, and in an environment so congenial
her abandonment of all attempt to share in
conversation with Kingston and Isabel became at once
more complete and less noticeable. She passed into
entire absorption in the details of daily life, lost any
wish to be in touch with intellectual life, took the colour
of her surroundings so perfectly that neither she herself
nor the others realized how completely she had withdrawn
from their company.</p>

<p>As for Isabel, the exasperating vividness of the
woman leapt into more violent relief than ever against
the smug complacency of Ivescar. At Brakelond Isabel
had been a part of the place; her individuality had
toned in with all the other individualities that had
gone to make up Brakelond. As one organ note is
inconspicuous among a crowd of other organ notes,
so Isabel’s nature had there been merged in a crowd
of other similar natures. Here, however, at Ivescar
the organ note of her personality sounded harsh and
tremendous, almost terrifying, amid the clacking babble
of mediocrity for ever kept up by the house. Only
trifling, futile people had had part in the building and<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
the life of Ivescar; their influence had left the place
a pleasant little chorus of tinkling inanities; and, by
contrast, the fierce song of Isabel’s nature rose dominant,
tyrannous, obliterating all the lesser voices around.</p>

<p>Kingston by degrees began to notice the disappearance
of his wife and the supremacy of her cousin in
his mind. Occasionally he showed a dim foreknowledge
of the inevitable by brief spasms of anger against
Isabel, by fruitless attempts to carry Gundred with
them in their flights. But by now Gundred’s mental
immobility had begun to be an annoyance to him, and
he was always glad to relinquish his efforts and fall
back into the familiar swing of dialogue with Isabel.
The faint air of greatness which for a time had been
reflected on Gundred from the walls of Brakelond had
now faded utterly. She was swallowed up in household
details, could be seen meditating on ‘menus’ while the
most fantastic notions were flying swiftly between her
husband and her cousin. Her life was now consumed
in coping with the cook; she was completely happy in
her task, and it was with growing readiness and growing
wrath that Kingston let her drop from his mental
intimacy. She filled up time by talks with her mother-in-law,
who had a dower house down the valley. The
somewhat woolly mind of Lady Adela was very congenial
to Gundred, and her small, clear-cut nature
found it both harmonious and restful&mdash;like her own,
though so utterly unlike. The two women took refuge
in each other; and Gundred, taken up by the house and
Lady Adela, would not have had the leisure, even had
she had the acumen, to remark how completely she
was passing out of her husband’s life.</p>

<p>‘Is the house insured?’ asked Isabel one morning.
Kingston and she were sitting together under the long
wall of the picture-gallery.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ he answered; ‘I always forget<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
things like that. My dear,’ he cried, calling to his
mother, who had walked up across the fields with her
knitting, and now had established herself in one of the
cushioned window-seats close to Gundred, who was
methodically checking a Stores List&mdash;‘my dear, is
the house insured?’</p>

<p>Lady Adela answered in the affirmative, and Gundred
made haste to clutch her share in a conversation that
she could understand, by swiftly affirming that, if not,
it ought to be at once.</p>

<p>‘Otherwise one feels it such a responsibility to live
in a house&mdash;yes?’ she added.</p>

<p>‘I don’t like betting and gambling,’ replied Isabel,
assuming a manner of exaggerated rectitude.</p>

<p>‘My dear!’ protested Lady Adela, looking mildly
up at her over her spectacles. If Lady Adela could
dislike anyone, she disliked her daughter-in-law’s new
cousin. Deep in her heart she condemned Isabel as
strong-minded. Tiresome and strong-minded.</p>

<p>‘It’s a gamble with Fate, you know,’ explained
Isabel; ‘all insurance is, of course&mdash;having a bet on
with the Almighty that He won’t burn down your house
or throw your train off the rails.’</p>

<p>‘My dear!’ protested Lady Adela again.</p>

<p>‘You have such strange fancies, Isabel,’ said Gundred
coldly. ‘You always think of things that no one else
would think of.’</p>

<p>Clearly, as delivered in Gundred’s neat, precise tones,
this was the final expression of righteous disapproval.</p>

<p>‘My feet must be extraordinarily small,’ said
Isabel to Kingston. ‘I seem to be always putting
them into it. They go into the most incredibly tiny
loopholes. I don’t believe I could walk across the lid
of a pepper-pot without putting my foot into it somehow.’
She stuck out both her feet in front of her,
and gazed at them dispassionately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[146]</span></p>

<p>The action may have been an instinctive appeal for
admiration. The feet, though large, were beautifully
shaped, with a suggestion of strength and swiftness in
their lines. But Kingston angrily compelled himself
to notice that they overlapped their shoes, that one
shoe had lost its buckle, and that the stocking above
each descended in wrinkles that betrayed a weakness
in the matter of suspenders.</p>

<p>‘Cover them up,’ he said. ‘Mine eyes dazzle.’</p>

<p>‘They haven’t died young yet, though,’ replied
Isabel, finishing the quotation. ‘Perhaps they will,
though&mdash;the feet, I mean.’</p>

<p>‘Why do you ask about insurance, Isabel?’</p>

<p>‘I was thinking that you might welsh the Powers that
be, and burn the house down, and get the money to
build a decent one. This great garish glassy palace
is not a bit at home here among the hills. You want
something sombre and quiet and self-sufficient as
they are&mdash;something that will be at ease with them.
This house of yours is about as much at ease among
the hills as a brewer’s wife having tea with half a dozen
Dowager-Empresses. You want a building that won’t
be fussy and assertive.’</p>

<p>‘Then want must be my master. You have the most
placid way of suggesting things. Do you always get what
you want yourself, quite irrespective of the means?’</p>

<p>‘What is the use of wanting things,’ said Isabel
defiantly, ‘if one doesn’t get them? One might as
well never want them.’</p>

<p>‘But what about other people? If they object?
If you can only win over their dead bodies?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, they must look out for themselves. Every
herring must hang by its own tail. It is everybody’s
business to get what they want. If they can prevent
me from doing as I wish, why, then they may; and
if they can’t, well, I romp in; and if they get in my<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
way while I am doing it, why, so much the worse for
them. They go under.’</p>

<p>‘There’s your crude individualism again,’ protested
Kingston. Then he turned to his wife, determined
to bring her into the dialogue. She was soberly conversing
with Lady Adela over the Stores List.</p>

<p>‘Are you an individualist, Gundred?’ asked her
husband. ‘Isabel’s a terror; she has no respect for
other people.’</p>

<p>Gundred finished her sentence calmly.</p>

<p>‘Besides, they say that spotted ones are bad for the
eyesight,’ she concluded, then prepared to answer her
husband. ‘What did you say, dear? Of course one
must respect other people, or how are other people to
do the same to us?’</p>

<p>Unlike Kingston, Isabel was inclined to resent her
cousin’s invasion.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Gundred doesn’t count,’ she cried. ‘Gundred’s
a civilized woman. Now, you and I are only pagans,
Kingston.’</p>

<p>‘My dear, dear child,’ exclaimed Lady Adela, unspeakably
distressed, ‘Kingston is nothing of the kind,
I am sure!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t trouble about Isabel,’ explained Gundred.
‘She is always talking nonsense&mdash;yes? Nobody ever
cares what she says. Go on talking to Kingston,
Isabel, but really you must not interrupt us any more.
We have our duties, Kingston, and you idle people must
not disturb us.... Dear Lady Adela, do you really
think we want a dozen of those common table-cloths?’</p>

<p>Kingston and Isabel were silent for a moment,
listening to Gundred’s conversation with her mother-in-law.</p>

<p>‘Well, I always believe it is best in the long run to
get rather too much than too little,’ replied Lady
Adela, pondering the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>‘Besides,’ amended Gundred, with a more cheerful
air, ‘they might give one discount on a quantity.’
Nothing should induce her to waste the superabundant
Darnley wealth. She licked the tip of her pencil,
prepared to tick off table-clothes with a lavish hand.</p>

<p>‘Would you say at eight and six each, or at nine
shillings?’ she asked anxiously, poising the pencil in
indecision.</p>

<p>‘Oh, for the servants, my dear, eight and six will be
ample. They wear out their things in no time. It is
quite shameful that they should be wanting new ones
already. I got them a whole supply only the year
before last.’</p>

<p>Gundred cluck-clucked.</p>

<p>‘Dear, dear,’ she said, ‘that Mrs. Bosket must really
be a very careless woman&mdash;yes? And she tells me that
new sheets are wanted as well&mdash;sheets and pillow-cases,
dear mamma.’</p>

<p>‘My child, how truly dreadful!’ answered Lady
Adela. ‘You must certainly keep a close eye on Mrs.
Bosket, though I do trust the poor thing is honest.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, perfectly, and most obliging, but not equal to
responsibility. One so often finds that in a household.
And it is so important to have an efficient head&mdash;yes?
I feel that one cannot safely leave her the ordering of
things like this, for instance. I have to do it myself.’</p>

<p>Had she had ten housekeepers&mdash;had she been the
daughter of two reigning sovereigns&mdash;Gundred would
still have insisted on ordering the table-cloths herself.
It was her nature, but she made a virtue of her nature’s
necessity, and fell to weighing the comparative merits
of pillow-cases at half a crown and at three and six.
Half a crown was eventually fixed on.</p>

<p>Isabel looked at Kingston. She saw that Gundred’s
dialogue had irritated him. Why his annoyance was
so keen she hardly knew. He himself would have<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
been puzzled to account for it. Her eyes triumphed
as she watched him, and obviously rejoiced at the
defeat of his effort to pull Gundred into their talk.</p>

<p>‘That’s all you are likely to get out of Gundred for an
hour or two,’ she murmured.</p>

<p>‘Martha is a much more pleasant, useful person
than tiresome, head-in-the-air Mary,’ he flashed back
at her resentfully.</p>

<p>‘Especially to talk to,’ replied Isabel mildly. ‘As
a matter of fact, a man wants both sorts&mdash;a Martha-wife
and a Mary-wife: the Martha-wife to air the beds
and order the dinner, and the Mary-wife to look at and
talk to. Most of the tragedies in history have arisen
from a man’s failure to get the two in one person.
Lucky men have an aunt or a sister, as well as a wife,
to fill the second part; but generally a man either has
a Mary-wife who talks brilliantly, but feeds him on
cold mutton, or a Martha-wife who will order a good
dinner, but can only talk about the servants. And
then he looks round for someone to think about meals,
while Mary discusses the soul; or to discuss the soul
while Martha is interviewing the cook. And then there
are complications. The whole system is wrong.
People ought to be much freer to get what they
like.’</p>

<p>Kingston resented Isabel’s tranquil description of
the Martha-wife. It had nothing to do with any case
they knew of. To talk about it was silly impertinence.</p>

<p>‘Individualism again,’ he answered. ‘You are an
anarchist, Isabel, like all egoists. Anarchy never pays
in the long run.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ admitted Isabel, ‘one has to pay for it in the
long run, of course. But until the bill comes in one
has a good time&mdash;quite worth the price one has to give....
Ask the lady behind you. There is a triumphant<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
instance of the Mary-wife, and the egoist, and the individualist,
all in one. She died for it at last, but she
had all she wanted while she lived. That is me; I’ll
die gladly, but I mean to have all I want till then.’</p>

<p>Kingston turned to look at the picture to which Isabel
pointed. From a background as dark as her end there
smiled out at him, enigmatically, whimsically, the face,
so much more prudish than passionate, of a woman so
much more passionate than prudish&mdash;the face of Anne,
“Marquis” of Pembroke, concubine and Queen.</p>

<p>‘So there is your model,’ he answered her contemptuously.
‘Well, she had her way, and her way led
her to the block on Tower Green.’</p>

<p>‘Let it. What does that matter? It had led her
first over the scarlet cloth of a throne. The price was
heavy, yes, but she always knew it would be. I expect
she was even glad to die at last, and have rest, and be
out of all her glorious, dreadful suspense. And the
splendour she bought was worth it. What do I care
for the bill I may have to settle some day? If I want
a thing, that means I intend to have it. Do you think
a beggarly consideration of economy would stop me?
Thank Heavens, I am not a miser. Why, to haggle
over Fate’s account would be like Gundred wrestling
for a twopenny discount off a pillow-case. No, Queen
Anne and I know better, don’t we, your Grace?’</p>

<p>Isabel rose and stared into the picture. The pursed
lips, the sly, slanting eyes beneath their demure lids,
responded mysteriously to her gaze. This was not the
woman that Holbein drew in the last hours of her
tragedy, weary, worn, and haggard; this was the
Queen of his earlier paintings, as he and Lucas Cornelisz
saw her in the radiance of triumphant battle,
the fierce adventuress-soul that, with nothing in her
favour&mdash;neither beauty nor position nor wealth&mdash;and
with everything against her in the fight&mdash;a kingdom,<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
a wife, a Church&mdash;yet by sheer force of brilliancy,
courage, and charm, fought her way at last, through
the wreckage of a religion, to the throne of a Queen.</p>

<p>‘Your Grace,’ said Isabel, ‘you and I are friends.
You were a pagan like me. What you wanted nothing
could stop you from getting, neither armies of enemies
nor any silly dread of the price to pay at the end.’</p>

<p>‘I wish you joy of your friend,’ said Kingston, filled
with inexplicable hostility. ‘Ask her what she thought
of it all at the end; ask her what she felt that last night
at Greenwich, when the King had deserted her, when
she was still treated as Queen by people bowing and
backing and saying “Your Grace” to her, who in their
hearts were all stealthy enemies from whom there was
no escape (with bets among themselves as to when
her head would be off and a new Queen crowned);
when she had to be brave and royal among all those
crowding black, invisible dangers, under the descending
shadow of the axe. Don’t you think she wished then
that she had not been such a pitiless individualist?
Don’t you think she wished then that she had been
allowed to live and die plain Lady Northumberland?’</p>

<p>‘Brave and royal you were, your Grace,’ cried
Isabel to the picture. ‘You never regretted, did you?
If you had, you would have been a poor lath-and-plaster
creature, unworthy of what you did. Your
nerves gave way for an hour or so. They had been at
full stretch for three terrible years of crowned suspense.
So it was no wonder they snapped just for a moment
in your fall. But it was not death you were afraid of;
it was just the crash and the dying. You were a
Queen at heart. You fought for your life as a Queen,
and in the end it was as a Queen you died. Nobody
else, not even in that strong, brutal time, died in such
an exaltation of gladness.’</p>

<p>‘An egoist should not be an idealist as well,’ protested<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
Kingston. ‘You make too pompous a song
about a peddling adventuress put shamefully out of
the way by a political job.’</p>

<p>‘Take care,’ cried Isabel. ‘When I knew her Grace,
she was not a lady to be spoken lightly of. Her enemies
only killed her because they did not dare to let her live.
Even her worst enemies dreaded her cleverness and her
courage. And her dying words must have taken the
skin off her husband’s back when he heard them. The
demure gentleness of them, the vitriolic irony of them!
You may have been “spiteful, flighty, and undignified,”
your Grace, but you were splendid, terrible, indomitable.
And you must have been marvellously charming
when you chose, you plain, prudish-looking creature
with six fingers and the devil’s temper. There’s a
Mary-wife for you, to hold the interest and curiosity of
the King, while his poor good Martha of a Katherine
was everlastingly saying her beads and hemming
shirts.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Isabel, I tell you that the song of history
is “Pay, pay, pay.” If you want to follow Anne
Boleyn, you must follow her all along the road.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Kingston, history may sing “Pay, pay,
pay,” but it sings to deaf ears when it tries to impose
its twaddling threat on well-bred souls. Only stupid,
parvenu people ever think of reckoning up the cost of
anything beforehand. It’s the hall-mark of recent
wealth to be sparing of its pence. One does not bother
about such things. One buys first, and only asks the
price when the time comes to pay the bill.’</p>

<p>‘And then the price may make you bankrupt.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no. Fate’s bills are paid in courage, and I hope
one would never be bankrupt of that. I think I shall
always be able to settle up. One plunges, like Queen
Anne. Your Grace did not stop to haggle. You and
I go boldly forward, order what we want from the<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
Stores of Life, and don’t give a thought to discounts
and reductions and Summer Sales. And then, when
the time comes, we fork up with a will, and pay out
our uttermost penny.’</p>

<p>For a moment Kingston did not answer her. He
stood looking into the secretive face of the Queen.
Gundred’s voice broke the silence.</p>

<p>‘I know where one can get them at two and six,’
she was heard remarking in her clear, level tones.</p>

<p>‘There’s Queen Katherine arranging the household,’
laughed Isabel, with insolent regardless frankness,
‘and here is Queen Anne ordering a crown across the
counter of life. No discount asked, and only the best
required.’</p>

<p>Kingston looked at her with rage in his eyes. She
was always saying crude things like that&mdash;things that
roused in him swift opposition and dislike. Yet he
remained helpless, as if bound by a spell. And her
indifference to everyone’s opinion was so profound,
her scorn of conventions so sincere that no reproach
could be brought home to her. She had no common
standard for measurement by the rules of the world.
One might as well have attempted to reprove a savage
for going naked, or an Englishwoman for going clothed.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ he said at last, ‘I hope your bill will be as
heavy as Queen Anne’s; then we shall see how you
behave when it comes to paying for it.’</p>

<p>‘But perhaps I have not really decided what I shall
order from the shop-keeper?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, I neither know nor care,’ replied Kingston
savagely. ‘And you don’t seem to have the decent
instincts of the real honest buyer, either. From the
anarchistic things you were saying a few minutes ago,
I should have thought you would have been a shop-lifter,
pure and simple, going in and stealing whatever
you wanted, without a thought of paying for it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<p>This time he had touched her. She flushed.</p>

<p>‘Oh no,’ she said. ‘When it comes to the big
things of life, I am as honest as the day. Love and
hope and so on I should expect and intend to pay the
top price for&mdash;pay it thoroughly to the last farthing,
sooner or later. I am only an anarchist in little things.
I might steal for a fancy, and assert my individualism
for a whim, but really, really, Queen Anne hasn’t a
thought of bilking when she orders her crown. Whatever
I buy I shall pay good money for, Kingston&mdash;pay
it ungrudgingly, if I have to die for it.’</p>

<p>Her earnest face, as she turned it to his, burning and
eager, had a strange fascination. He turned roughly
away towards his wife.</p>

<p>‘We are talking about Anne Boleyn,’ he cried, raising
his voice to penetrate Gundred’s attention&mdash;‘how she
had her fun, and then paid the money.’</p>

<p>‘And nine is twenty-one,’ answered Gundred, completing
her sentence in mechanical tones.... ‘What,
dear? Oh yes, Anne Boleyn, poor little thing! so
dreadfully treated by her husband. The first martyr
of the Church of England.... And now, about
prunes, mamma?’</p>

<p>Kingston, angry and disappointed, turned again to
Isabel. Primly, inscrutably, Queen Anne smiled
down upon them from the wall. She had heard
about that martyrdom before. She knew better.
She had been the martyr of ambition, not of dogma;
she sold her life for a crown, not by any means
for a faith. And she thought her martyrdom the
grander. In her passionate mysterious heart she pondered
Isabel’s brave declaration, and wondered whether
the modern woman, too, would be content to pay her
debt, when the time should come, for the big things
she had ordered at the counter of Fate. Beneath the
riddle of her smile Kingston and Isabel fell once more<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
a-talking, while across the room Gundred was still
ticking off groceries, and exchanging plans of household
economy with her mother-in-law.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>


<p>‘Yes, very, very pretty,’ said Gundred approvingly.
‘No sugar, thank you.’</p>

<p>Delicately, with neatly-lifted little finger, she raised
her cup and sipped. From top to toe she was the fine
flower of deportment, and her manner exhaled a mild
consciousness of being the perfect model of decorum
for the country neighbour on whom she was conferring
the honour of a call. The afternoon being
brilliantly fine, Lady Adela had wished to take her
daughter-in-law to call on some intimate friends of
hers, proprietors of a celebrated view, who lived on
the other side of the lowland valley that stretched
beneath the glen of Ivescar. Gundred was happy in
the opportunity of exacting provincial approval, and,
against everyone’s wishes, including his own, Kingston
had insisted that he and Isabel should join the polite
pilgrimage. Accordingly the landau had duly sallied
forth with its burden of four, and after more than an
hour’s drive through the soft country beneath the hills,
had brought them to their destination. Now, on the
famous terrace of Blakebank, Gundred sat full in the
light of her hostess’s admiration, consuming cakes and
tea with her usual crisp yet ethereal daintiness.</p>

<p>‘The lights on the hills!’ cried Mrs. Norreys ecstatically,
anxious that Mrs. Darnley should appreciate the
full beauty of the prospect.</p>

<p>‘Delightfully pretty,’ replied Gundred, casting a
comprehensive glance across the world. ‘One quite<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
envies you, Mrs. Norreys. We have no view like this
at Ivescar. A charming place to have tea, out on this
terrace. Oh, thank you. How greedy I am!&mdash;yes?
But this air makes one so famished, and these little
cakes of yours, so delightful.’</p>

<p>With a sweet smile Gundred accepted a second cake,
and devoted her whole attention to its decent consumption.</p>

<p>In front of Blakebank the ground sloped away
sharply to the river far down below. Dense woodland
filled the hollow in which the water flowed, and rose
again in a blue foaming mass on the farther side of the
valley. Thence the eye followed undulation after
undulation of meadow and copse, fields of soft green,
plumed hedgerows, a placid country full of opulent
peace. The foreground of the picture was formed by a
strip of meadow beneath the terrace that dropped in
a steep brow towards the woods. Here the grass was
hidden and gilded by a sheet of buttercups, and the
pure ardour of their gold was touched to a keener fire
by the shafts of sunlight that slanted across them.
Beyond their blaze lay the voluminous splendours
of the woodland, dull and heavy in sullen shadow.
For the day had its sharp notes of contrast. The air
was leaden and lurid, dazzling, here and there, with
a golden rain of sunlight, and here and there, again,
made sombre by thunderous masses of cloud. Huge
curling crags of purple and silver rolled and towered
above the world, and the sky was opalescent with a
hundred shifting colours. The landscape, drowsy and
complacent, was transfigured into something mystic
and dreamy. From the poignant glory of gold in the
foreground the eye wandered on over the steamy blueness
of the woods, over the rippling waves of vaporous
green and blue that filled the valley, to where, seeming
very far away across the glamour, the great rampart of<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
the hill-country lay high against the faint rosy lights
of the north. The lowering air, the sleepy, fantastic
colours of the day, seemed to remove things distant to
another world, and the mountains, dim, misty in shades
of amethyst and azure, hardly appeared distinct from
the ranges of cloud amid which they faintly loomed.
Far away, far above the valleys, they lay in crests and
billows of dreamland along the border of a fairy world.
Yet only six miles of comfortable peace was all that lay
between Gundred at her tea and those mysterious
giants in the haze.</p>

<p>Full in the middle of that walled horizon, isolated
on all sides, rose the mass of the Simonstone, unrolling
his apathetic splendour on the ranges of lesser hills
that formed his throne. In steep, precipitous slopes
his lines dropped abruptly to the western valley; to
eastward they trailed away in long, placid curves.
The ranges of white limestone that formed his pedestal
shone dimly pink across the distance, and the towering
bulk of the mountain was lucent as a carved sapphire
from crown to base. His sheer stern western cliff,
his flat summit, loomed disdainfully over the sleepy
valleys at his feet; and his presence, serene and enormous,
ruled the whole country with the inevitable
weight of its majesty. Steep glens in the range divided
him from the heights to either side; he stood out the
conspicuous tyrant of the horizon. Away to the right,
over a range of smaller fells, the leonine head of
Ravensber stood up in secondary authority, and above
the western cleft where Ivescar incongruously squatted
in the undiscoverable distance, rose the slouching back
of Carnmor. But of the trinity that dominated the
hill-country, Ravensber and Carnmor, the lesser and
the greater, were both subordinate to the imperious
sweep of the Simonstone. Here, from the terrace of
Blakebank, in the complete contemplation of his<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
grandeur, might be perceived the full grotesqueness of
the insolence that had planted Ivescar beneath the
sombre glory of his shadow. From that parvenu house
itself the blatancy of the contrast was not so evident;
for Carnmor and the Simonstone were both shut out
from view by the amphitheatre of white cliffs that
closed in the glen, and gave support to their dominating
mass. But to Blakebank, far away, the whole
supremacy of the hills lay revealed in all its greatness,
and their empire seemed, in the mysterious clouded
lights of rose and blue, to belong to a world that
had no knowledge of man or his evanescent doings.
Gundred, meanwhile, having finished her tea, began
to think of departure. She set to work delicately
drawing on her gloves and preparing her farewells.</p>

<p>‘Such a long drive&mdash;yes?’ she said; ‘I am afraid
we must really be starting, Mrs. Norreys. My husband’s
aunt is coming to us to-day, and we ought to
be home in time to receive her.’</p>

<p>The carriage was ordered, and the party stood exchanging
compliments and politenesses.</p>

<p>‘Such a delightful day,’ said Gundred, ‘and a drive
home in the evening so charming in weather like this&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘You will have a lovely view of the hills as you go
home,’ replied Mrs. Norreys. ‘You will have them in
front of you all the way. Do notice the sunset-lights;
too exquisite they are.’</p>

<p>Long habit had developed in Mrs. Norreys a proprietary
manner when she talked of the distant hills that
made the attraction of her terrace. She spoke of
them as a successful actor-manager might speak of a
scene that his own great skill has contrived and
arranged.</p>

<p>‘Charming, charming!’ answered Gundred, with
the enthusiasm which everyone thinks it a duty to<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
manifest for landscape, though the true intelligent
passion is so rare and sacred.</p>

<p>Then the carriage was announced, and the party
from Ivescar embarked on their homeward voyage.</p>

<p>Kingston and Isabel had not contributed much to
the gaiety of the entertainment. They had been possessed
with the delight that Gundred had merely
expressed. To them the beauty of the world as it lay
unfolded before them had been so vast and holy as to
make all comment obtrusive and irreverent. Kingston
had felt the unspoken sympathy of Isabel’s mood, and
her silence had mitigated for a time the feverish animosity
with which he regarded her. As they drove
home, there was little conversation between the four.
Now and then Lady Adela made some remark on Mrs.
Norreys’ kindness, her charm, the successful blend of
her tea. But even Gundred was feeling too serene for
speech. Everything combined to make her happy.
Her gown was a perfect fit, the evening was comfortable,
and she was conscious of having given her hostess
a flawless model to copy&mdash;in manners, conversation,
hair, and hat. Of course she never doubted her faultlessness
or felt a qualm, but there were moments when
its lovely perfection came upon her in a compelling
wave of pleasure. She sat in a rapture of satisfaction
as the carriage whirled her home through the quiet
sunset. Tea and a good digestion assisted the placidity
of her mood, and the influences of the atmosphere
collaborated to make it complete. The twilight was
pink and sweet as Gundred’s own opinion of herself.
Immovably tranquil, roseate and mild, it had the
fascination of a drowsy fairy tale. Cowslip and bean
and hawthorn sent her their tribute in wafts of
fragrance. She accepted everything as her due, and
felt that all the world was showing a very proper
spirit in conspiring to do her honour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>So their road led them up and down the gentle
slopes that filled the valley with ripples of green.
Sleepy old farmsteads they passed, nestling in dense
knots of verdure, and villages with their brilliant little
strips of garden. The day’s work was over, and in
the clear air rose the song of peace and rest. Only far
above, over the nearing mass of the mountains, rose
stormy ranges of cloud, flushed and splendid in purple
and gold. And so at last they had done with the
broad lowland, and the road set itself to mount up
towards the high glen of their destination. Now the
country changed. Below lay the wooded, feathery
richness of copse and hedgerow, meadow and pasture.
Stone walls began to replace the hedges, stiff wiry
moor-grass the lush growth of the valleys; the framework
of the earth was near the surface; the soil became
a thin stretched skin, no longer a warm soft coat of
flesh; here and there the film broke, and the limestone
bones protruded. So the road wound its way to the
upper levels, and climbed at last to the glen between
the hills. Far ahead of them it streamed away up
towards Ivescar&mdash;an undulating stripe of whiteness.
Above, to their right, rose, stiff and stark, a wall of
white rock, shutting out from sight the mountain
above. To their left lay the narrow desolation of the
defile, a stream meandering among sparse meadows,
with here and there a bare barn or a farm surrounded
by a few wind-tormented trees. And beyond these
again, towered the farther wall of the valley, another
escarpment of long limestone cliffs, which could be
seen rising tier upon tier to the first brown and violet
slopes of Carnmor. The road, hugging the western
precipice, commanded a full view of the valley’s eastern
rampart, but of the cliffs overhead revealed only the
first and lowest range. This, in the sunset-light, was<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
radiantly pink, but the sheer rocks across the stream,
cut off from the light, were grey and grim, rising up in
bank upon bank towards the moors above. No colour
touched them, no softness made them lovable. Their
inhospitable, irreconcilable sternness foreshadowed the
abomination of desolation, and gave the valley a
stony, lifeless melancholy that recalled the land that
once flowed with milk and honey, but is now a wilderness
of sterile stone.</p>

<p>As the road led on up the narrowing pass, so the
shadows deepened across the way of the travellers.
Suddenly, however, the western wall of cliffs overhead,
now no longer touched by the sun, dipped in an abrupt
cleft; and there, very far above them, hung the sheer
western face of Simonstone. Keen, precipitous, menacing,
the mass of the mountain impended suddenly
over the valley, and the apparition was almost terrifying
in its unexpectedness. Another twenty yards, and
the lower ranges would once more conceal it from
view; here, for a swift moment, it revealed its over-lordship
of the glen at its feet. Behind and over its
brow high volumes of cloud stood stationary, and in
the glow of evening the mountain and all the upper
air was rich with a glamour of amethyst and hot
violet.</p>

<p>Gundred was dominated by this revelation, and her
powers of expression rose to the emergency.</p>

<p>‘Oh, look, how pretty!&mdash;yes?’ she cried, indicating
the obvious with a neat wave of her neat hand.</p>

<p>Never had her gift for inadequacy burst upon her
husband in such a terrifying flash. For a moment he
could not speak.</p>

<p>‘Quite good,’ he answered at last, incapable of
saying more to a woman who would have been incapable
of understanding it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>Isabel remained silent. Her eyes were fixed. Then
she put out her hand in an eager gesture to stop the
carriage.</p>

<p>‘Stop them, Gundred,’ she cried; ‘I want to get
out. I am going up there into the glow and the glory.
I am tired of this dull grey world. Kingston, come
with me. Let us go and be gods on the heights.’</p>

<p>Gundred saw consent in her husband’s eyes. The
carriage was stopped.</p>

<p>‘Well, don’t be late for dinner, darlings,’ she conditioned.
‘Remember, Aunt Minna will be arriving.
Do you really think you will have time?’</p>

<p>‘What does time matter!’ exclaimed Isabel rebelliously.
‘There is no such thing.’</p>

<p>Kingston would have liked to go alone. Gundred
had just succeeded in irritating him, he felt, to the last
point of endurance. Her bland impenetrability was
nothing short of tragic. Nothing could ever teach her
what to say and what to leave unsaid, for nothing
could teach her to feel. She had the sublime elephantine
tactlessness of perfect self-satisfaction. Her
husband, for one wild moment, wanted to get away
from it all&mdash;from Gundred, level, monotonous, stodgy,
yet unsatisfying; from the dear good old mother who
did not count, who never could count; from Isabel,
tormenting, tantalizing, odious Isabel. To be alone,
up there in the radiance, far above the world of desire
and dissatisfactions&mdash;that would be, at least for half an
hour, rest and relief. But he was to have none;
Isabel was to come, emphasizing at every point the
exasperating perfections, the exasperating limitations
of his wife. With her usual primitive clumsiness, so
utterly at variance with Gundred’s well-drilled movements,
Isabel flounced out of the carriage, alighting
with a jumping flop that brought down a coil of hair
and a shower of pins. Kingston noticed that, as<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
usual, her placket was open. He waited in silence till
she should have finished her untidy adjustments.</p>

<p>Gundred repeated her injunction.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Minna will be so surprised if you are not
there in time to receive her,’ she said. ‘Do be certain
that you have time, darling.’</p>

<p>Kingston forced himself to speak. ‘Ivescar is just
over the hill,’ he said. ‘We shall be there as soon as
you. It will be a short cut&mdash;up one side of the Simonstone,
and down the other. Are you ready, Isabel?’</p>

<p>Yes, Isabel had finished tucking up her skirt. It
was a skirt as inadequate for visiting as for mountaineering.
And now she had bunched it up on one side to
give her legs full play, and its effect was not only
incongruous, but lumpy and lopsided. However, for
such matters Isabel cared nothing. She was ready.
Without another word, Kingston turned aside and
opened a gate. Together they passed through into the
field bordering the road, on their way to the copse
above, that sloped up to the limestone cliff, and so led
on to the heights overhead. Gundred watched them
go. A faint, a very faint ripple of doubt trembled
across the calm waters of her self-complacency. She
had the strangest, the most ridiculous, the most unheard-of
feeling that in some way she had not been at
the height of the situation. In some way, she had a
dim instinct of having failed. As the carriage drove
on, she suddenly found herself feeling a little lonely,
a little cold.</p>

<p>Kingston and Isabel wrestled their way to the cliff’s
top, and found themselves on a flat floor of scar limestone
that led straight away to the long, swift slope
of the mountain. As if arranged by mortal hands, the
blocks of white stone made a regular pavement, like
the wrecked foundation of some Cyclopean temple.
Between each block was a deep, dark rift, where ferns<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
and lilies of the valley, and strange flowers with white
plumy spires flourished in the shelter where no wind
could ruffle them. Together the wanderers crossed
the level, leaping and balancing lightly from rock to
rock. Then heather and sedge began to break the
even surface of the paving, and soon usurped its place
altogether. Thence, to the summit, was nothing but
moor and whortleberry, steep slopes of shale and grit.
Kingston and Isabel addressed themselves resolutely
to the ascent. Steep and arduous as it was, they had
neither time for breath nor talking. They climbed
strenuously, silently, taking pride in each step that
proved their mastery over the earth by lifting them
steadily higher, foot by foot, on the flank of the
mountain that had seemed at first too vast to be conquered
by any movements of so infinitesimal a creature
as man. Slowly but certainly they found themselves
advancing up the stark ladder of tussock and poised
boulder. Each stone that they dislodged rolled crashing
into farther depths, and at last they found themselves
moving into the cold shadow of the clouds that evening
seemed to be drawing down upon the summit. The
crown of the mountain was now beyond their sight,
cut off by the fierce angle of the slope; but they could
see that the upper air was still aglow with sunlight
round it, though the volumes of dark vapour seemed
to be growing and darkening. Suddenly the acclivity
took a swifter line, then paused for a moment from
its labours. Surmounting it, they found that the
ground lay for a few yards in a gentler curve, and
there beyond, straight above them, was the summit,
glorious and crimsoned. A last eager voiceless effort,
and they had attained it. Around them whistled and
hurtled a sharp wind, and before stretched away the
round level plain of the hill’s crown.</p>

<p>It was with a sigh of relief that the climbers rested<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
and faced round to see the extent of their conquest.
The whole world far beneath them was misty, ardent,
gorgeous in the glamour of evening. Kingston and
Isabel made their way to the ruins of the old cairn
that had sent northward the news of many centuries.
Among the scattered, rough-hewn boulders they settled
themselves for an interval of repose in achievement.
Behind them rose the ruined wall of the beacon tower
that had talked, in its day, of Queen Jane and Queen
Mary, of the Armada’s coming, and the passing of the
Tudors. Before them, unrolled at their feet like a
map, two thousand feet below, was all the splendour of
the earth, phantasmal and glorified&mdash;tiny towns, and
the worm-like track of great rivers, the minute tessellation
of meadows, and the dim velvet of wide forests.
The whole air, before them and beneath, was a-tremble
with motes of gold. Gold filled and pervaded the atmosphere,
confounding detail in a haze of glitter, and
softening the great dazzling stretches of the western
sea into an imperial harmony with the golden heaven
and the golden earth.</p>

<p>Kingston Darnley looked out across the glowing
mystery beneath him. Rest, profound and eternal,
seemed to be enveloping him. In reality, the very
foundations of his nature were stirred and stirring.
Insensibly, through the heat and worry of the foregoing
days, his life had been growing ripe for a great
upheaval. Slowly the tormenting desires, the incessant,
unacknowledged hunger, the uneasy, restless,
emotional uncertainty, the strenuous nourishment of
artificial feelings, had all combined to bring his restless
unhappiness to a head. Through unacknowledged
storm and secret stress he had come at last to that
deceptive calm which precedes the breaking up of the
soul’s settled weather&mdash;the discharge of the soul’s
accumulated electricity in a devastating nerve-cyclone.<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
To-day his endurance of himself and his own forced
contentment had touched its limit. Gundred had given
him the last least touch that was needed to destroy the
perilous equilibrium of his mood. Unconsciously he
was waiting, in a breathless interval of suspense, for
the crash of thunder that was to precipitate the crisis,
and clear the air of all its unhealthy restraints.</p>

<p>Suddenly as he lay there, with Isabel silent and
watchful at his side, the glory of the world shivered
coldly and vanished. A black shadow swooped over
the mountain-top, and soon only the uttermost distance
retained the glimmer of gold. Down, down upon the
old cairn sank, like the portcullis of a fairy castle, a
heavy curtain of darkness, shutting out all that was
left of the gleaming distance. The cloud was upon
them. And, as their gaze was fixed on the gloom
descending from above, no less abruptly, no less silently,
in grey coils and whirling streamers the mist curled
up at them from beneath, rippling and foaming over
the rim of the mountain, as a devouring wave sweeps
round an islet and over its crown. In an instant the
world was blotted out by the white darkness. Uniform,
monotonous, it obliterated everything. Only the old
cairn and a few yards of ground around it could now be
seen. Kingston and Isabel were cut off from the earth,
set alone as Deucalion and Pyrrha in a new sphere,
one solid point amid a vast ocean of chaos....</p>

<p>‘So much for the glory of life,’ said Isabel.</p>

<p>Kingston rose. ‘I don’t like this,’ he replied. ‘It
will be the very mischief to get down again. Come
and help me find a way.’</p>

<p>Together they moved away from the old cairn into
the mist. As they went it widened before them,
revealing a few dim feet of distance, then closed in again
behind. Through the drifting pearly gloom objects
were strangely magnified, made mysterious, portentous;<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
rocks became monsters looming through the
darkness, the level crown of the mountain, shifting
fantasy of vapour. The ground beneath their feet
seemed to swirl and shift with the movement of the
fog, and, now that shape and colour had vanished
from the world, an enormous crushing silence dominated
the air. Faint and melting before their eyes
stretched away the few visible yards of the flat soil,
covered with short sedges, and, among the loose piles
of grit, with a thick growth of little mountain-sorrel,
whose brilliant reds and yellows had been levelled by
the blank twilight into a sombre note, as of stale blood
spilled out among the stones. Then, beyond, the solid
earth wavered away into a phantom, revealing here
and there a rock or a patch of grass, uncertainly,
evanescently, as a faint, half-guessed shape, as the mist
lightened or lowered.</p>

<p>So they wandered carefully on across the plane of the
summit, till suddenly, ahead of them, grim and mysterious,
rose a long grey barrier fading to right and left
in the profundities of darkness. It was the old boundary
wall of the summit, built by Celtic kings in the
lost ages when the hill-top was the last great British
outpost in the north. Humped, shapeless, an indistinguishable
mound of stone, the old wall remained
intact, running round the plateau in a solid ring,
unbroken except at the point where the beacon tower
stood. Knowing that outside its precinct cliffs and
pitfalls awaited the unwary, Kingston and Isabel
turned, and set themselves to follow it on its circuit,
hoping to find an outlet or a path. At one point they
came on a small stone chamber built into its bulk, but
no sign of gateway or track could they discover.
Now they were crossing a bare part of the summit, a
wilderness of rocky wreckage. Here and there, at
short intervals, great rings and semicircles of half-buried<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
stone could be divined in the level of the soil,
foundation-lines to show where the huts and palaces
of the Celtic kings had stood. Now they were but
dim ridges, grown with dwarf sedge and sorrel, through
which roughly burst the gritstone bones of their fabric.
Adventurous climbers of the mountain had had their
fun of the rocks that former occupants had made their
houses and defence. Often the flat, hewn blocks had
been lugged from their places by modern hands, to
be arranged in some riddle or motto. One ambitious
tourist had perpetrated a great design. Kingston and
Isabel came suddenly upon it. It stretched bravely
across the earth, a device of big boulders, carefully
arranged. ‘I love you,’ it said to them, in its audacious,
solid letters. ‘I’ and ‘you’ at either end of the
legend faded away into the white obscurity beyond,
and at their feet lay ‘love,’ obtrusive, unconquerable,
built of sound stones so square and firm as to defy the
enmities of time and weather.</p>

<p>‘I love you,’ read Isabel slowly.</p>

<p>Hitherto few words had passed. Words, in that
blanched silence, seemed futile and impertinent.
There was in that vast loneliness of the mist a sense of
intimacy too close to be profaned by speech; man
and woman were alone, two halves of one primitive
creature, in a primitive, floating chaos, where nothing
else, as yet, had taken shape. How could such a drifting
void hold anything so formal as speech? Speech
belonged to that forgotten world of things visible and
tangible, that world where other human beings lived,
and there was light, sound, movement. Here, in the
level, immovable silence of the primeval twilight, Kingston
and Isabel found the intervening ages swept away.</p>

<p>They had gone back into the dim time before the
dawn of the world, when there was nothing more than
this poised existence, vague, voiceless, pervasive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>‘I love you,’ repeated Isabel, studying the tourist’s
device&mdash;the blatant modern cry breaking into the
abysmal stillness of old chaos.</p>

<p>Kingston, with an effort, tore himself from the white
mist of fantasy that had closed in upon his mind.
The gloom suddenly held dangers; they loomed ahead.
He had a dim sense that something unseen was moving
towards him out of the swirling uncertainties around.</p>

<p>‘It’s no good,’ he said. ‘We shall have to stay here
till the clouds lift a bit. I simply can’t pretend to know
my way. We should probably wander half over the
moors, and go on in a circle till we got hopelessly lost
or fell in a pothole. What a fool I was not to watch
the sky! However, if the worst comes to the worst,
you can shelter in that little shanty, and I don’t
expect Gundred will be anxious; she never is.’</p>

<p>‘Read what this creature has written,’ said Isabel.
‘It sounds better in a man’s voice.’</p>

<p>Kingston looked down at the straggling stone letters
at his foot. ‘I love you,’ he read. Then he looked up
at Isabel.</p>

<p>She was facing him. The motto lay between them.
Her face, against the luminous pallor of the mist, was
burning, aglow, filled with a strange triumphant
challenge. Suddenly, with an appalling crash of
thunder, the fantastic world in which he had lived so
long shattered and broke about his head. He saw the
call in her eyes, understood it, answered to it, helplessly
as a bound slave. This was the one woman in the world.
He had known her since the beginning of time, been
with her since the creation; now at last she threw
aside her veils, and stood before him, no longer a
stranger, but the lost part of his own soul&mdash;that lost
part for which he had so long been vainly seeking.
Now, in an instant, he recognised the cause of all his
enmity, his unrest, his gnawing hunger, the incessant<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
angry cravings which had tormented him. Hitherto he
had not seen the truth; he had guessed it. And those
guesses, painful, secret, stifled&mdash;they had engendered
all the throbbing hostility, all the restless enmity with
which he had regarded this half-recognised intruder
into his life. Now he knew her, now his heart heard the
lost language for which it had pined, now his soul stood
complete again in the acquisition of its lost part.</p>

<p>Isabel saw that the answer to her call had come. At
last she was known. ‘Old friend,’ she whispered,
smiling into his eyes.</p>

<p>‘You&mdash;you,’ he stammered. ‘And I did not
understand. It is You. I have never seen you before,
Isabel, and yet&mdash;and yet I have known you all my
life.’</p>

<p>Suddenly she was clothed in glorious beauty from
head to foot. From head to foot she was altogether
splendid and desirable. Every inch of her called aloud
for his worship. As the sooty kitchen-maid of the tale
strips off her rags and stands revealed a King’s golden
daughter, so now the accidents of Isabel’s disguise, the
untidy hair, the shapeless clothes, all passed out of
Kingston’s consciousness. Henceforth she stood far
above such peddling criticism. The rules of his
ordinary taste could never apply again to this recovered
spirit out of the dead ages. She was his&mdash;his right, his
property, his existence. She was altogether without
fault or blemish, the completion of himself.</p>

<p>‘You are beautiful,’ he said in a low voice&mdash;‘you
are beautiful, the real Isabel. I never guessed what
beauty was. It is you, Isabel. It has always been
you.’ Wonder at the miracle possessed him, tied his
tongue, gave him the pathetic little blundering gestures
of the blind&mdash;of one suddenly emerged from a lifetime’s
black darkness into the blinding glare of daylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[171]</span></p>

<p>‘You have come to me at last,’ smiled Isabel. ‘I
wondered when you would. You have been trying not
to wake.’</p>

<p>‘I have been holding my eyelids down,’ he answered.
‘I have been making myself blind. It has been hell;
Isabel ... Isabel!’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she replied&mdash;‘yes. You have been denying
me ... you have been denying yourself. It is Peter’s
crime. Of course it was hell. But now you have
confessed the truth&mdash;the truth which was from the
beginning.’</p>

<p>He stared at her&mdash;the man made perfect in full self-realization&mdash;at
her, the woman, whole and entire in
her reunion with himself. Soul imperiously cried to
soul, and body to body. She had the unimaginable
beauty of the thing created by its lover, loved by its
creator. Every line and curve of her was perfected
handiwork of his own rapture. The loveliness that he
saw in her, his own heart, his own flaming fancy had
planted there, had fashioned and worshipped as the
lover always fashions the idol that he worships.</p>

<p>‘How is it,’ he said hoarsely&mdash;‘how is it you can
be so beautiful, Isabel? You are not beautiful. My
eyes know you are not beautiful. And yet my heart
knows better. My heart knows there is nothing
like your beauty&mdash;nothing like it, Isabel, anywhere
in the world. My soul is twisted up in every part of
you; there is something of me in every part of you.
Your hair, your skin, your eyes&mdash;they are me, Isabel;
I have given myself to make them. Can you understand
it, Isabel? There isn’t an inch of you in which
the sinews and the nerves of myself have not always
been woven and twisted.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ she cried, answering his low tones with a deep
burst of feeling. ‘We have been together through
the worlds. We are not strangers. That is what you<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
mean. You have buried yourself in me, and I have
buried myself in you. We belong to each other. We
have always belonged together. There are only you
and I in this white pale world. That is what real
lovers are. Alone&mdash;alone together for ever and ever
and ever. Nothing can ever break our solitude&mdash;nothing
can put itself between us&mdash;if only we are
honest with ourselves.</p>

<p>‘Isabel, what does it mean&mdash;this that we feel?
What is it that we are?’ he asked, whispering as if
in the presence of a sacred mystery.</p>

<p>‘Ourself,’ she answered triumphantly&mdash;‘ourself,
awake, brought to life, welded together again. We
have come out of a hundred ages. Do you suppose
that we come together now for the first time? How
do we know each other, then? This that we feel is
the song of many dead souls calling in each of us to the
many dead souls that have loved us in the other. We
have been bound together since first we met in the far-away
distance of things. Love is that. Love is never
a new thing. Love is the oldest thing in the world.
It has lived through a hundred thousand deaths of the
body, and gathered strength and knowledge at every
stage of its journey. It’s a jewel of a hundred thousand
memories crushed together and crystallized into a pure
sparkle of lights. It’s a chain of a hundred thousand
links, each heavier than the last, and more golden.
Kingston, the chain is round us and round us. Tie it
tighter, tighter, for ever and ever. We will live everlastingly
in this land of splendid bondage.’</p>

<p>‘Isabel, what is it the wise people of the East say?’
answered Kingston, in the stupefaction of ecstasy.
‘They pledge themselves to one another for half a
dozen lives or more. Isabel, that is what you mean.
You and I are both bound together. We’ll plight our
troth again now, far ahead into the future. For a score<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
of existences, Isabel. Our love was not born a minute
ago; it will not die to-morrow. It goes on and on,
whatever bodies it takes to clothe itself. Our love is
the only thing of us that goes on. And nothing can
destroy it. It is ourselves. You are mine, Isabel, and
I am yours&mdash;you are me, and I, you, not only now, in
these shapes of ours, but through half a hundred more
that are not yet born, Isabel. Isabel, what do words
and talking matter? We cannot get away from each
other; we are the same person. Now and always,
Isabel. But we will never lose ourselves again; we
must always recognise each other.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she said, ‘again and again and again. For
ever and always. You have been trying to cut me,
Kingston&mdash;<em>me</em>! trying to cut yourself.’</p>

<p>‘You are chained to me, Isabel, and I to you! I
will never break the chain at my end; you must never
try to break it at yours.’</p>

<p>‘No; we are always the same person henceforth.
Why, there is no bond. We are too close together now
even to be bound.’</p>

<p>She stood gazing at him, her eyes, her pose, her
manner inspired with conquest. The blank, sickening
ferocity of passion seized him as he answered her look.
It caught him by the throat, swept him away in a
rapture of agony. To crush that beauty of hers, to
mangle it, strangle it, absorb it utterly in himself, became
at once the one blinding, obliterating need that filled
his whole consciousness. An insatiable thirst of her
loveliness possessed him. The keen, flame-like delirium
of his desire was a devastating pain. His
whole being moaned with the aching torment of it.
The sight of her, the thought of her, went through him,
pierced him, rent his innermost heart in twain. The
drunken glory of suffering that held him on the wheel
of knives was a frenzy very different from that placid<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
repletion which had been his ideal&mdash;how long ago?&mdash;of
the great ideal passion. Now at last he knew what
passion was&mdash;the parching, gorgeous misery of it, the
straining, leaping martyrdom. The ancient secret
madness that once had dwelt in the orderly rooms of his
father’s heart now stirred again in the son’s, and bled
once more, under the wounds of ecstasy, as once, for a
wild hour, it had bled long since at the hands of that
ill-fated, forgotten woman whose place was now
usurped by Isabel. Kingston, his calmer self destroyed
by the red intoxication, moved towards his fate,
vaguely, blindly.</p>

<p>‘Isabel&mdash;Isabel!’ he murmured with dry, cracking
lips, groping hands outstretched to take her.</p>

<p>And Isabel welcomed his coming as the crown of
life. She threw his arms wide and waited, glowing
and transfigured.</p>

<p>The ghostly twilight of the mist was round her, behind
her. The face it revealed was fierce with joy,
exquisite in its vividness. The dark hair drifted round
it, and the throat rose vivid and white from the low-cut
collar of her dress, thrown back splendidly, an
ivory column. The neck of her dress was fastened
awry by a little brooch, whose diamonds gleamed
dully in the pale glooming.</p>

<p>And in an instant the man’s flaming drunkenness had
passed&mdash;passed utterly, in a spasm of torment almost
beyond his bearing. As sometimes we are torn painfully,
violently from the gay madness of a happy dream
by the sound of a bell or some other noise that penetrates
to our consciousness from the outer world beyond
our vision, so now, in the crisis of his passion, the sight
of his wife’s brooch at Isabel’s throat recalled Kingston
Darnley, with a jarring crash, to the horrible realities
of life. Isabel, characteristically buttonless and pinless,
had borrowed it from Gundred to make good the<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
deficiencies of her blouse. His arms fell, the light of
his eyes grew dull, and died. His body stood motionless,
and his spirit went down into the abyss of hell.</p>

<p>Isabel saw the change, and at the sight her own
glory sympathetically faded. They had done with the
heights. Now their feet were set on earth again.</p>

<p>‘Isabel&mdash;Isabel!’ he repeated. But the flame of his
utterance had died down into a grey dreariness.</p>

<p>Isabel saw that her moment was passing. A horrible
anxiety possessed her. ‘What is it?’ she cried.
‘Kingston, what is it? What has come between us?’</p>

<p>He pointed to the brooch. ‘Gundred,’ he answered&mdash;‘Gundred.
We had forgotten.’ He was suffering
so acutely in the death of passion that he could hardly
make his words intelligible. The wrench was agonizing.
Passion was not dead, but his heart knew that it must
die&mdash;that he himself must be its executioner&mdash;must
cast out the guest that was the dearest part of himself&mdash;cast
it out and cut the throat of it. He desired still
with all his soul, but knew that his desire must rest for
ever unfulfilled. He belonged to Gundred. He must
face his own responsibilities.</p>

<p>Isabel could not hear what he said. But she
shivered in the cold that had fallen upon them. Without
words she understood what it was that had cut
down the flower of his rapture in a moment, what
drawn sword it was that had suddenly thrust itself
between them. She stood withered and stricken with
the shock, grown suddenly pale and old.</p>

<p>Kingston was fighting down his pain, struggling with
it, and gradually bringing it into bounds. He was too
clear-sighted to give himself any hope. Had he been
sprung of a more lawless stock, of men accustomed to
love where they chose, without consideration of morality,
he might have taken his pleasure as it came, and
never given a thought to self-reproach or duty. But as<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
it was, bygone generations stirred again in him, of men
who had lived cleanly, decently, according to their
lights, avoiding the wild urgencies of passion. Law,
custom, convention had ingrained into them a respect
for rule and restraint, and now their latest descendant
reaped in his own person the cruel reward of all their
virtues. To go further in the ghastly labyrinth was
impossible. Joy was unattainable. Only duty could
be pursued. And for shirking that there could be no
excuse.</p>

<p>Without a word he turned and walked away from
that ill-omened motto on the hill-top. Vaguely, with
hands thrust down into his pockets, he wandered on,
crushing down the misery, the angry clamours of his
nature, and steeling himself violently to the preservation
of what remained possible to him of decency. For
the sake of Gundred, of himself, of Isabel&mdash;for the sake
of his love and hers, he must at least live as clean as
might be. The struggle was a martyrdom, though,
the shock of self-mutilation a grinding, lancinating
anguish.</p>

<p>Isabel stood for a moment, then followed him across
the flat ground. She soon caught him up, and they
advanced together in silence through the driving mists.
Suddenly, vague and ghostly, the old cairn rose before
them again, looming mountainous. When he had
reached the stones at its foot, Kingston threw himself
down upon its steps with a heavy gesture of lassitude.
And still the silence ruled.</p>

<p>‘Isabel,’ he said at last, in a dull, tired voice&mdash;‘Isabel,
you must forgive me if you can. I have been a
beast. I must have been off my head. I feel as if I
had been drunk, and was only just beginning to come
to. Whatever rot I talked you must try and forget it,
Isabel. I can’t make out what the devil can have
come over me!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>

<p>The woman gave him an angry, challenging glance.
‘No,’ she said, ‘I won’t forget it. You spoke the
truth. Why are you beginning to tell the old weary
lies again? Surely we have got beyond that.’</p>

<p>Her words, her defiant tone, caught his attention.</p>

<p>‘You didn’t understand,’ he said. ‘I was a brute;
there’s no more to be said. Don’t try to say any more.
Of course you can’t understand. My God, what a
damned muddle I have made of things!’</p>

<p>‘But of course I do understand, Kingston. Nothing
can undo what you have said. It didn’t need saying,
and no amount of denials can ever make it untrue.’</p>

<p>Kingston looked at her anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Isabel,’ he said in a broken voice. ‘Do you realize
what you are saying? I was fool enough to tell
you&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘What we both knew before in our heart of hearts,’
she interrupted passionately. ‘And now we know
each other. Oh yes, I understand you. All of a
sudden you have been overcome by some absurd
qualm&mdash;some whim or other. You think we are to be
separated by some ridiculous fad.’</p>

<p>Amazement held him. This time he fixed his eyes
on her and spoke slowly, laboriously, as one speaks
English to someone who can only understand a foreign
language.</p>

<p>‘A fad!’ he repeated. ‘Hang it all, Isabel, is honour
a fad, and decency, and all the rest of it? One does
what one can. Is it only a whim?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she answered violently. ‘It is only a whim.
These artificial scrupulosities of yours, they are just
middle-class superstitions. You belong to me, and I
belong to you. We know that is true. Very well,
then; why should we deny in deed what we know to
be true in fact. Oh, I have no patience with such
whims. Nothing can separate us; why should we<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
pretend to be separated by the fact that you have got
what you call a wife? I am your wife. You have no
other. You can’t have another. Your only duty is
to me&mdash;to me and to yourself. All the rest is mere
romantic sentimental nonsense.’</p>

<p>His fastidiousness swung him back into a reaction
of almost physical repulsion as he contemplated her.
The impossibility of making her understand any
honourable point of view was dreadful. He loathed
her with all his heart as she sat there trying to enforce
her claim. And yet he could not deny her claim,
and, despite his shuddering disgust, he loved her as
much as ever, reluctantly, angrily, but with all the
secret unreasoned impulses of the bondage that held
him.</p>

<p>‘Isabel,’ he said, with forced gentleness, ‘can’t you
even try to understand? I am sorry. Yes; it is
true what you say. We belong to each other. Nothing
can alter that. But I have given my word to someone
else, and I must&mdash;don’t you see?&mdash;having struck
the bargain, I must keep it. Make it a little easy for
me, Isabel, though God knows I don’t deserve it. But
one wants to keep one’s self as clean as one can.’</p>

<p>‘I won’t make it easy for you,’ cried the other, beginning
to realize that he had entrenched himself
behind a wall of determination. ‘Clean? You won’t
keep yourself clean by playing the hypocrite with
Gundred.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, God! Poor Gundred! It is a dirty game I
have played with her all along. And yet I never
knew. Before God, I never understood. I meant to
deal fairly, and I will deal fairly, too, as fairly as I
can. The mistake was mine, and I’ll pay for it&mdash;pay
for it all alone. Don’t you see, whatever happens, she
must not suffer, Isabel. She&mdash;she has given me all
she had to give. So much for so little, Isabel. I<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
must never let her guess that I haven’t an equal love
to give in return.’</p>

<p>‘As if she will not guess it every day and hour of her
life! Do you suppose you can deceive her?’</p>

<p>‘At least, I can give her a decent show in the eyes
of the world,’ replied Kingston, showing a really subtle
knowledge of Gundred’s temperament. ‘That will be
better than nothing, any way. Oh, Isabel, the whole
affair is a damned horror. It’s all my fault. But we
shan’t make it any easier by letting ourselves go to
pieces over it. The only thing I can do now is to save
myself from being any more of a brute than I can help.
Yes, I know we love each other; we shall always love
each other, worse luck. But we must spend the rest
of our lives trying to forget it. We must kill our knowledge,
Isabel. It’s the best thing we can do, damn
it, for the best that is in us. I’ve made my mistake
and had my fling, and come my cropper; now I must
stand the shot.’</p>

<p>‘It is not as if you could,’ cried Isabel&mdash;‘not as if
you could pay your debt by yourself. It falls on me,
because I am a part of you. I have to pay the heaviest
price of all. I have done nothing; I have made no
mistake; and now I am to pay!’</p>

<p>He stared curiously at her excited face.</p>

<p>‘We pay together, then,’ he said slowly, ‘and we
pay a heavy price to keep our love for each other untarnished.
That is what it comes to. I’ll pay anything
not to tarnish my love for you, Isabel, my
opinion of you. It is all I have left. I must save
that at any costs. And save a&mdash;well, a little rag of
my own decency, too. You are asking me&mdash;I hate
saying it, but it is true&mdash;you are asking me to dishonour
both of us by dishonouring my wife. I rate
our love and ourselves a little higher than that, Isabel.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you are bloodless!’ she answered passionately&mdash;‘a<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
bloodless prig! There is nothing of the
man in you. Have you <em>nothing</em> in your veins&mdash;no
warmth, no life at all&mdash;that you can go on talking
these frigid fancies of yours? Where do you come
from&mdash;what are you? What are you made of? Can
you feed your passions with these romantic metaphysics?
What’ll they give you? Will they warm
you when you are cold&mdash;with Gundred? Will they
feed you, when you are starved&mdash;by Gundred? Will
they give you company, when you are alone&mdash;with
Gundred? Talk of your honour and mine! Our love
is our honour. There is nothing else in the world.
Gundred is nothing; there is no such thing as Gundred.
I have blotted her out of existence!’</p>

<p>Never had the pagan egoism of Isabel been more
terrifying, more repulsive. Through his love he hated
her as he watched the cruel swift sneer of her nostrils
as she talked of his wife.</p>

<p>‘Have you no shred of pity?’ he asked quietly.
‘Think of Gundred. The most damnable thing in the
world has happened to her. She has given herself&mdash;her
whole self&mdash;and got nothing in exchange. Can’t
you at least let her have pity and respect? Poor
little Gundred! I thought it was a square bargain
when I struck it. I thought I gave her all I had to
give. I swear I thought so. And yet all the time I
belonged to you, Isabel, and you to me. Don’t you
see that the only thing we can do now in common
honesty is to spare Gundred all we can, and spare ourselves
the dishonour of cheating Gundred even more
than we have already?’</p>

<p>But Isabel was beyond appeals, frankly barbarous
and merciless. ‘Gundred took her risks. All women
do when they marry,’ she said. ‘And now she does
not count any longer. What sort of man are you, to
be pining about Gundred when I am here by your side?<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
Look at me&mdash;yes, look, look&mdash;and see how long you
can remember Gundred.’</p>

<p>She fixed his gaze with burning eyes. But he
turned away his head and refused to take up the
challenge.</p>

<p>‘I suppose it is your right,’ he answered, ‘to make
everything as hard for me as you can. I deserve it, I
know. Oh yes, you blot out all thought of everything
but you, as soon as I look at you. You are the
only thing I can see in the world. And I won’t look
at you, Isabel. It is no use. Must I tell you again?
I won’t stain the love we have for each other by any
further treacheries towards the duty we owe to each
other and my wife. Oh, Isabel, if you would only
believe me, it is because I love you so awfully, so
damnably, that I cannot look at you, or touch you. I
love you too much. I ache in all my bones with the
love of you, and I love you too much and too well to
satisfy my love. Oh, don’t you understand? We
could never forgive ourselves, never feel clean again.
Our love would have been spoiled, made filthy and
horrible with deception and mean lies and beastliness.
It’s a sort of responsibility we have, to keep it clean.
We can’t kill it; it is there, it always will be there.
But, at least, we can prevent it from turning us black
and rotten. I’d sell my life, Isabel, to have our love
free and honourable&mdash;I would, Isabel.’</p>

<p>Isabel laughed. ‘Oh, this dry and tedious discussion!’
she cried. ‘How many men would hair-split
and quibble like this? Thank God, I have blood
in my veins! My people never cared where or whom
or why they loved. They took their pleasure where
they found it. They were above all laws but their
own desires. No silly conventions and superstitions
ruled them. They were big, passionate men and
women, with life in their veins, not sawdust.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[182]</span></p>

<p>‘Do you care nothing, absolutely nothing,’ he asked,
‘for&mdash;well, for feeling that you have behaved as
cleanly as you can? Nothing for consequences?
Nothing for anything but the pleasure of the moment?’</p>

<p>‘It is in my blood,’ repeated Isabel arrogantly, investing
the crude horror of her selfishness with a certain
barbaric grandeur. ‘You know how I hate these
huckstering considerations of yours. My self-respect
is involved in getting what I want. Defeat is my
only shame. And consequences&mdash;who cares for them?
I know,’ she went on, giving the quotation with proud
defiance&mdash;‘“I know that about this time there is a
prophecy that a Queen of England is to be burned, but
I care nothing if I be she, so that I have and hold the
love of the King.” The love of my King I have and
I hold; what does the rest signify? I told you Queen
Anne and I were cousins.’</p>

<p>‘How I wish,’ he said&mdash;‘oh, how I wish to God I
could make you understand what I feel. I feel the
most contemptible beast on the earth; you alone can
help me to win back a little of what I have lost. If
only you would make it easier for me, Isabel&mdash;if only
you would make it easier for me, by believing how
ghastly hard it is.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; hard, hard, hard,’ said Isabel&mdash;‘hard I believe
it is,’ she repeated, meeting the anguish and the
struggle of his gaze. ‘And I want to make it harder.
I want to make it impossible. Find yourself, Kingston&mdash;know
yourself. Don’t go on tormenting us both
with scruples and neurotic nonsense.’</p>

<p>He rose and stared down at her with furious eyes.
‘You are pitiless,’ he said&mdash;‘altogether horrible and
evil. There’s no decency or civilization in you. You
are as fierce as a savage. As I listen to you I hate you;
every fibre in me hates and dreads you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>Isabel rose also and faced him. ‘And when you
look at me?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘When I look at you,’ he groaned&mdash;‘when I look at
you, every fibre of me longs for you and cries out for
you. And yet I swear I hate you, Isabel.’</p>

<p>‘Go on hating me, then, like that,’ answered Isabel
triumphantly. ‘You have conquered me now. I
feel that I cannot get near you again. For I know
what that hatred means. And some day I shall win.
I am bound to. You belong to me. You <em>are</em> me.
You recognised that a few minutes ago. But now you
are a fool. You refuse your happiness. Well, one
day I shall bring you to it again.’</p>

<p>‘Let me go, Isabel,’ he pleaded. ‘Let us try to do
the little best we can, you and I. Don’t make our
lives more difficult or shameful than they need be.
Oh yes, I know that you have everything in your
power&mdash;too well I know it.’</p>

<p>He spoke wearily in a low, broken voice that seemed
to foreshadow the end of his resistance. As his weakness
grew manifest Isabel’s strength grew greater.</p>

<p>‘There is no escape from me,’ she said. ‘Remember
I am yourself. And I shall always be there at your
side, in your house, waiting, waiting till you wake
up again from this foolish dream.’</p>

<p>His struggle had suddenly collapsed into the helplessness
of fatigue. Even at this defiance of hers he
made no sign of revolt. ‘Oh, God,’ he said, ‘how can
I get rid of you? What chance am I to have? But
it is no use talking. One can’t talk the same language
as you&mdash;one can’t talk in the same century. It is hopeless,
I know. Your ideas are as savage as Queen Isabel’s&mdash;you
have got all that fearful barbarous selfishness of
hers, and one’s only chance of making you understand
would be to talk to you in the old French that she
must have spoken.’ His voice trailed off into silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[184]</span></p>

<p>Isabel drew closer to him, and laid her hands softly
on his arm. ‘Kingston&mdash;&mdash;’ she began.</p>

<p>He shook off her light touch, and looked her full in
the face. His eyes were blazing, and his manner
had the restrained roughness of passion held hard in
leash.</p>

<p>‘Isabel,’ he said, ‘if you touch me, I swear to God I
love you so much that I shall kill you&mdash;here and now,
with my naked hands.’</p>

<p>She believed him, and was exalted by triumph.
‘Ah,’ she cried, ‘you do love me. You are becoming
a man at last. That would be a good death to die.’</p>

<p>‘Body and soul of you,’ he went on fiercely, ‘hateful
and glorious&mdash;I might destroy them, mightn’t I, but
never could I be rid of them. I know there is no
escape, Isabel. And now surely you can let me be.
I am bound to you now and for always. Isn’t that
enough?’</p>

<p>Isabel smiled. ‘Enough,’ she cried. ‘It is everything;
now or later, what does it matter? I win.
I win. Kingston,’ she added, dropping indifferently
from the heights of emotion to the plain lands of prose,
with something of that unconscious ease which one might
have imagined in the nature of a woman like Isabel the
Queen, the very prose of whose life was emotion, and
whose emotion was so practical as to be daily prose of
her existence&mdash;‘ah, Kingston, I am tired. I am simply
dropping with weariness. Are we going to get down
off this mountain to-night? Because, if not, I must
try to sleep in that hut we saw. And I know you will
not be able to run away from me.’</p>

<p>‘Sleep, by all means, if you can,’ he answered.
‘There is no going down through this mist. Luckily
the night will be fairly warm, and by morning the
clouds will have broken. But you will be hideously
uncomfortable, I am afraid.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[185]</span></p>

<p>‘No,’ she replied; ‘I am naturally primitive. I
have never minded roughing it.’</p>

<p>Exhausted by their discord of wills, they now, by
mutual consent, talked coolly and indifferently, casting
memory behind them.</p>

<p>Kingston helped Isabel to find the hut, and did what
he could to make it habitable. Then, leaving her to
get what rest she might, he returned to his thorny vigil
under the old beacon. The air was motionless, and
not ungenial in its temperature. Enveloped above
and below in blank darkness, he had the sensation of
being balanced softly in space. The calm, after the
ardent misery of their dialogue, was inexpressibly refreshing.
He abandoned himself to its placid influences,
and instead of devoting the night to a thrashing
out of all the many difficulties that threatened his relations
with Gundred and with Isabel, he let it drift him
away into the domain of peace. He hardly knew how
completely exhausted he had been, and it was with the
surprise which always attends us when we find ourselves
doing prosaic things that seem at variance with the
high dramatic moments of life they follow, that at last
he found himself floating quietly off in sleep.</p>

<p>Anguish was still there, deep down in his heart&mdash;a
bruised feeling of hunger and dissatisfaction, a great
shame for himself, and a great pity for his wife, as well
as a firm resolve that she should not suffer. But
passion had dulled the edge of its own intensity; only
dull aching pains were left, rather than acute stabbing
ones. Disappointment and hopelessness possessed
him in an inexorable but not agonizing grip. In fact,
he was too weary to feel the full weight of the yoke
that was laid upon him. Cradled in the great silence,
his tired consciousness sank at last to rest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>


<p>When Kingston Darnley woke, the clouds had broken.
Overhead was the clear vault of stars; beneath, a vast
flocculent sea of milky whiteness. Already the eastern
air was lightening with the first green tremors of dawn,
and the warm calm of the night was giving place to
the keen freshness of a new day.</p>

<p>Kingston could rest no longer. He rose, and wandered
to and fro across the summit, thinking out the
situation in which he had become involved. A force
too great for his resistance had swept him into its
dominion; so much was certain. The force was hateful,
paradoxical, inexplicable. But its grip was at his
throat, and no struggles could extricate him. The
whole face of the world had suddenly changed; hidden
things had been made clear, and things which had
once been thought precious and sufficient were now
shown in the light of this strange sunrise to be altogether
false and valueless. No reluctance, no blinking
of facts, no well-meant pretences, could alter the fact
that life had suddenly opened out before him, enormous,
passionate, in all its scope, and that, in the revelation
the mountains of bygone days were dwarfed to molehills.</p>

<p>But these changes ruled only in the secret places of
the heart. There remained the practical aspect of
things. In the depths of his soul he now carried with
him a knowledge of what was highest and most glorious
in life, but that knowledge must for ever be buried
in the depths. His own rash action, in the days before
he had understood, before he had been awaked, had
put it eternally beyond his power to stretch out his
hands openly, and seize the happiness that his soul
had found. Chains of diamond might bind him now<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
and for ever to this second self that he had discovered;
but chains of his own making, of his own riveting,
made him prisoner to another life, in the lower world
of daily existence. In the clear cold of the dawn the
heats and tempests of his brain seemed to grow calm;
he saw more and more clearly into the future and its possibilities;
passion and its stress had given way to a cooler
appraisement of circumstances. His nature, emotional
rather than sensual, helped him to regain his balance.
It was on the spiritual, transcendental side of his
feelings that he dwelt.</p>

<p>This love of his for Isabel, this love which came from
outside, which had nothing to do with moral or æsthetic
approval&mdash;it should be a thing altogether high and holy.
To keep it clear of contamination, to sanctify it by
restricting it to the loftiest regions of life&mdash;this was the
task that lay before him. The task might be difficult.
Isabel might try to increase the difficulty of it. But
he would gather strength from the very difficulty of his
position, the very intensity of his passion, which, by
the sheer weight of it, must lay so great a responsibility
upon him as his soul must needs rise to bear. For the
heavier the weight, the easier it is to endure; the soul
braces itself sternly, deliberately, to the labour, and
carries off the burden of a crushing load more triumphantly
than the straws which daily life and little
desires impose&mdash;the straws which seem of no account,
and for which, therefore, the soul makes no preparation,
stiffens no muscles to sustain. Against a lapse
Kingston felt himself defended as much by the solemn
ecstasy with which he had come to accept the fact of
his passion as by his sense of the redoubled duty which
it made him owe to the other life that he had innocently
involved.</p>

<p>Tragic affection possessed him as he thought of
Gundred;&mdash;Gundred, giving her all&mdash;that all which now<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
appeared so little; Gundred, whose greatest gift had
now become inadequate, yet must never be slighted or
discarded. In a moment he saw the vast distance that
now separated him from his wife. Had they ever, in
reality, been close together? Now, without conscious
treachery on either hand, time had removed them very
far away from each other. He understood what impulse
it was that had lately been making him try to
pull her back into his life, and realized how completely
she had passed out of it. There was no fault in her&mdash;at
least, no other fault than a limitation of nature.
How he himself could have escaped the penalty of his
own character he could not see. The crisis of remorse
was passing. He had committed no deliberate sin
against his wife. What had come about had come
about through no volition of his. If he loved Isabel
that love was something outside himself&mdash;something
that he could not kill, though he might duly cage it
and control it. To cage it and control it accordingly
was all that remained for him to do. Infidelity,
treachery, adultery of the flesh would be an unpardonable
treason to his love and his loyalty; the adultery
of the heart is a thing instinctive, inevitable, committed
sooner or later by many blameless men and
women. This, the most important of human treasons,
stands for ever beyond the reach of human restraint.
No judge can analyze it, no jury weigh it; it can be
valued by no damages, absolved by no divorce. The
marriage of heart with heart is a matter outside the
reach of law; the world and its laws are only concerned
with external and visible manifestations. Let the
outward life be clean and seemly; but nothing can
govern the impulses of the inner secret life. Its
movements can only be prevented from reacting
shamefully on daily demeanour; they can never be
measured, foretold, forbidden. Kingston knew that<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
his heart was faithless to his wife&mdash;knew that, in reality,
it had never been pledged to her at all. Her heart to
his, perhaps; but he had pledged her nothing, he found,
but his approval, his affection, his respect. All the
more reason, then, that, having bought so much of her,
and for coin so innocently false, he should pay his debt
to the uttermost farthing in the only money he had to
pay. Respect, affection, approval, all that he had
pledged and promised&mdash;these should be paid without
grudge or chicane, and the very completeness and
honesty of these tributes must atone as far as possible
for the cruel fact that he had no more to give her.
In the fullness of his tribute to Gundred he must find
at once the redemption of his own self-respect, the safeguarding
of her happiness, and the glorification of this
love of his, that might sink so low, and might be made
to rise so high.</p>

<p>The whole air, vibrating with cold intensity, was now
of a poignant emerald. In the East it grew keener and
keener from moment to moment. Beneath, at his feet,
through the milky sea of cloud, the heavy presence of
the lowlands began to pierce, and grew from mere
darkness into dim husky purples. Against the fierce
green of the dawn a few clouds stood out fiercely black
against the pure sky. The deep abysmal blue of the
night was flying westward, retreating, fading, passing.
Now it looked wan and worn; the faint stars staled
and grew sickly as morning lamps. Slowly, very
slowly, the world began to stir, to reveal itself far
down in the valleys and distances. Detail had not
yet been delivered of chaos, but gradually the separate
existence of hill and hollow showed itself in flat masses
of obscurity. And then the tones began to change,
to grow sharper, more real. In the first dawn outlines
had been clear and hard, the blackness dense and without
modification. Against the pale horizon moorland<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
and mountain had stood out hard and stark, as if cut
from cardboard. Now the haze of atmosphere began
to clothe the new-born world in glamour, faint, mysterious,
phantasmal. Along the eastern rim of the darkness
stretched the swooping profile of Ravensber,
like a lion couchant, flushing now, from a thing grey,
cold, and dead, to a living mass of opal. Diaphanous,
vague, uniform in colour against the pulsing vividness
behind, the far-off mountain came nearer, its azure and
amethyst grew every moment keener. At its feet the
lower hills still lay dim and indistinguishable, but to
them also life was returning; and as the great leonine
shape above took warmer and warmer shades, from
the first vaporous dimness of opaque blue to the splendours
of a transparent jewel, so the intervening fells
grew deeper in their tones of violet, more solid, more
easily discernible among the faint mists in which the
dawn had vested them, and from which they now
began to separate themselves, while out of the vaporous
films of the sky long trails and volumes of cloud were
beginning to condense.</p>

<p>Emerald was now passing into topaz, and the rolling
masses of distance seemed every moment a shallower,
greener blue. For the oldest and most primeval of all
colours is blue&mdash;that vast, profound sapphire of midnight.
But as darkness dies before the advance of
dawn, each colour recedes westward as its successor
presses hard upon it out of the East. Blue gives place
insensibly to green&mdash;to green, faint at first and tremulous,
then growing swiftly more sharp to its note of
greatest pungency. And so, when the lucence of
emerald is at its height, it rises abruptly into yellow&mdash;a
yellow very pure and thin, and coldly pale. Blue
has faded out altogether. The air has the vivid
transparency of a topaz. Quickly the clear light intensifies
itself, and passes on into richer, angrier tones of<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
saffron and flame. Then, last of all, crimson and
scarlet appear, final heralds of the approaching day.</p>

<p>Already, very far up in the shrill green of the zenith,
a few feathered clouds were growing pink. The
Ravensber, now, was of a rosy blue, and the sky behind
it thrilled with gold. The air rippled cool with increasing
keenness, and the awakening earth seemed to
await an imminent summons. Gradually the details of
the earth below could be discerned in blocks of uncertain
light and shadow. It seemed as if the day were pausing
on its road. The golden east grew increasingly golden,
and the green overhead grew pale and melted; but
to eyes that had watched the swift advance of the
earlier stages this tantalizing moment of suspense
seemed interminable. The world now was purple and
azure; the Ravensber stood out no longer the phantom
of a dream. Life was growing plain and plainer.
But still the poignant moment hovered indecisively
on its way. The path of the sun was barred with
streaks of cloud. Ashen grey and violet in the beginning,
they had kindled at last through wine colour to
an ardent amethyst, and their lower surfaces were edged
with rose. As their fluffy masses mounted the sky,
their surfaces grew brighter, their purple warmer, till,
high overhead, their last faint drifts were now of a uniform
glowing pink. Everything was ready for the sun:
the earth was clean and fresh from its sleep, the air
was vivid and clean and sparkling.</p>

<p>When the last change came, it came with a blinding
abruptness after its delay. The fire of the clouds grew
swiftly fiercer, their purple turned to molten bronze,
their edges broadened, became red, scarlet, flaming.
Kingston saw now the exact spot where the sun was to
rise. Down in a cleft of the hills, where far-off Ravensber
tailed away into the first slopes of Fell End, there
lay the heart of the cloud-drift, and there through its<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
sombre curtains, the sun would have to break his way.
Crimson and scarlet dominated the world now, throbbing
from horizon to horizon. Splashes of infernal
sanguine began to streak themselves across the East,
growing every moment in number and in violence.
The day was hurrying up in a leaping fury of splendour,
and the path of the sun was a ladder of flame, leading
upwards from the ravelled veil of darkness between the
hills. And then, in a moment, the curtain of the clouded
East was gashed suddenly and rent asunder: the earth
seemed swept by a blast of blood and fire. The sun
was up. Another instant, and his awful globe had
leapt free of the broken masses of bronze beneath, and
was mounting on its tyrannous way through heaven.</p>

<p>Instantly before his glory all rival splendours faded.
Scarlet, crimson, gold, and orange paled and died in
the glare of his presence. The magical moment was
passed. Clouds, mountains, and valleys were mere
clouds and mountains and valleys again; the transfiguring
radiance was dead. Only the air was still
pervaded by the red glow. The world was torn from
dreams to reality again. Calm, clear, definite, it lay
below, stripped of mystery, a world of men and women,
fears and desires, eating and drinking.</p>

<p>Kingston walked round to where the western edge
of the mountain dropped away to the fells far below.
Beneath those, again, lay the narrow glen where Ivescar
stood. Between the Simonstone and Carnmor it cut
its way southward and then sloped down into the great
valley beyond. The Vale of Strathclyde stretched
softly through the distance, very broad and fertile,
to the remote low hills that bounded it on the farther
side. From where he stood Kingston could see its
whole course mapped out before him, far away, clear
and rosy in the fresh daylight. In a swooping curve
it flowed westward under the wall of the mountain<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
country, westward from its source away in the east, in
the heart of Yorkshire, out to where its last placid
ripples passed into the indistinguishable golden glory
of the western sea. And there, beyond the low cleft
in the woodlands, where a faint smoky haze betrayed
the town of Lunemouth, the vast, flat glitter of the bay
ran farther and farther out, till it was merged in the
bright opalescence of the sky, against whose gleaming
softness rolled northward, in dim sapphire, the jutting
ranges that passed up into the tangled mountain chaos
of Cumberland and Westmoreland.</p>

<p>Trees, steeples, villages, stood up clear and vivid
everywhere in the valley beneath, remote and tiny in
the depths; but where each river coiled and writhed
through woodland, there coiled and writhed across the
face of the earth a monstrous sleepy dragon of white
vapour. Higher up, again, in the narrower mountain
valleys, wherever water flowed, the runnels of its course
were filled with a dense bellying mass like pale smoke.
From the hills behind, too, from the stern, deep-channelled
country of fell and moor, rolled down
towards the lowlands of Strathclyde great sluggish
remoras of mist, blotting out each hollow in a snowy
void, and leaving only here and there a little islet of
dark rock or heather in the white swirling sea of their
tide, as they lapped and curled round the lesser hills
below. As the sun grew stronger, their volume
momentarily ebbed and melted, but in the first
moments of day the glen of Ivescar brimmed over with
their confused currents, beneath the brow of the
Simonstone, and as Kingston gazed down over the
edge, he looked into a blank and woolly vacancy.</p>

<p>While he stood there Isabel approached. There was
no more battle, no more challenge in her air. Knowledge
of the truth was enough for the hour. In the
cold clear purity of dawn the ardours and agonies of<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
passion could have no place. Kingston and she had
found the great secret of their common life; no more
words were needed.</p>

<p>Kingston turned to her.</p>

<p>‘We may as well be starting down,’ he said. ‘It will
be easy enough now. I only hope Gundred has not been
in a great state of anxiety. Did you get any sleep?’</p>

<p>‘It was a bony bed,’ replied Isabel, ‘but I managed
to rest quite fairly. But I feel utterly tired and
squashed. Do let us go home, and get fed and cleaned
and decent again.’</p>

<p>‘In a few minutes,’ said he, ‘we shall hardly be able
to believe we have ever been up here. This night will
seem like fancy.’</p>

<p>‘Or else we shall feel that we have been up here all
our lives, since the very beginning of things. Kingston,
I was angry with you, but you have taken me
up on to a mountain, and showed me more beautiful
things than I ever thought there were in the world.
I have been thinking. Perhaps I understand a little
better now.’</p>

<p>He studied the calm radiance of her face. The sun
fell full upon it, gilded and glorifying.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Isabel,’ he said, ‘we must do what we can.
We must try to&mdash;to honour ourselves. I am glad you
begin to understand. After all, nothing can take
away the thought of what we have found together up
here, you and I. And we must not let that thought
get spoiled, Isabel. How pompous I sound, though!’</p>

<p>She sighed. ‘I am always running my head up
against the walls of life,’ she answered. ‘I think I do
see now what a mistake I made. I hurt myself and
you. Oh, I shall never pretend to have conventional
morals like you, but I am beginning to understand that
self-denial is sometimes a splendid form of self-indulgence.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>The thrill of the new day, the glowing serenity
of everything around him had their influence on
Kingston. His emotions reached calmer, greater
heights than before, above the reach of storms. His
tongue was loosened for a moment.</p>

<p>‘We are above the world, Isabel,’ he said; ‘let us
try to stay there.’</p>

<p>She looked at him, her smile touched with irony.</p>

<p>‘And yet,’ she answered, ‘you are going to lead me
down into the valleys. Do you think one could always
stay on the heights?’</p>

<p>‘At least we have been there once in our lives,’ he
replied. ‘How many people can honestly say that?’</p>

<p>‘The valley is full of clouds and mists,’ said Isabel,
peering down. ‘Death and horrors may lie below us.’</p>

<p>‘We are going there together, Isabel. We shall
always be together now. We cannot help it, even if we
wanted to. Nothing can release us from each other.’</p>

<p>‘Not even the deaths and horrors?’ asked Isabel
slowly.</p>

<p>‘Why suppose that there will ever be any?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I am cold and cramped, perhaps; I am frightened
of things all of a sudden. Even you and I will
have each to go alone into the Valley of the Shadow,
Kingston. You will not be able to go with me there,
not even if we are to meet again on the other side. I
am dreadfully afraid of death and dying. Life has
suddenly become more lovely than ever. I love it
and worship it. Come with me into life. But, even
with you, I don’t like passing out of this warmth down
into the mists and cold damps below there.’</p>

<p>‘They will have disappeared by the time we get on
to the lower flats,’ he answered. ‘Let us set off.
They are thinning every minute.’</p>

<p>With a last look round the radiant plain of the hill-top,
Isabel followed him over the edge, and down the<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
first steep slope. Instantly they were out of the sunlight
and the glow, in chill shadow as yet untouched
by the influences of day. Down and down they
plunged towards the mists beneath, while, far overhead
now, the rosy beams of the day shot out across
the world, cut off from them as they went by the
intervening bulk of the mountain, sombre and stark.
So they came at last to the pavement of white limestone
below, and stood on its last, lowest ridge.
Beneath them, grey, barren, inhospitable, lay suddenly
revealed the topmost end of the little valley, hemmed
in by its amphitheatre of cliffs. The mists were
scattering now in desolate wisps of vapour, and the air
was cold and dank in the shadow of the mountain
behind. Through the torn veils of the white fog they
could see clearly down upon every detail of the glen&mdash;the
shape of each poor profitless field of brownish grass,
enclosed by intersecting lines of stone wall, with here
and there an ash-tree or a hawthorn, weird, tormented,
witch-like, crouching eternally beneath the lash of the
wind, and shivering in its sparse, blighted garment of
leaves. Just below them rose the struggling stream, out
of a stone slope thick with nettles that dropped away
steeply from the foot of the cliff; it wandered homelessly
through two or three grim meadows, where wiry
herbage battled with the white outcrop of stone,
then passed through a grated barrier into the domain
of Ivescar. From the height of the cliff Ivescar itself,
house and plantation, seemed more impudently vulgar
than ever. The plantation filled the valley, glaringly
artificial, glaringly unsuccessful, a serried army of
wretched dwarfish little pines. And in the middle shone,
steely and cold, the square expanse of the lake, and by
its side, isolated on the desert of lawn, the house itself,
dome, tower, pinnacles and all, raw, yellow, brutal
in its contented ugliness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[197]</span></p>

<p>Kingston and Isabel gazed down at it with distaste;
then they turned from the mournful glen, filled with
chill shadow and sterile discomfort, to look back at the
mountain from which they had descended. Very high
overhead towered the imperious western face of the
Simonstone, and the whole mass was glowing now like
a thing alive, flushed with pulsing blood and vitality.
From crown to base it was kindled to an ardent and
luminous crimson, at once sombre and gorgeous, at
once brilliant and terrible. Kingston and Isabel
looked up at it in silence for a moment, then plunged,
without a word, down into the bleakness of the stony
valley. Another moment, and the mountain had
vanished from their sight. They were in the cold
shade of the cliffs, and the upper glories were hidden.
So, still silent, they made their way through the fields,
through the elaborate iron gates of the park, and into
the pretentious deserts of Ivescar.</p>

<p>Gundred had a quiet, practical spirit. When her
husband and her cousin had failed to reappear in time
for dinner, she wasted no energy in grief or anxiety,
but came to the conclusion that they must have lost
their way, and either found some other haven, or, at
all events, taken the most prudent steps possible in the
circumstances. It was never in her calm nature to be
harassed without good cause; she always expected the
best till she heard the worst, and gave everybody
round her credit for coolness and imperturbable
sagacity equal to her own. Accordingly on this occasion
she made her husband’s apologies to Mrs. Mimburn,
dined without agitation, and slept the night
through in placid confidence that the wanderers would
return with the morning. Her perfect trust in Kingston’s
sense precluded all anxiety as to his welfare,
and her perfect trust in his affection all anxiety as
to his absence. When at last Kingston and Isabel<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
returned, Gundred received them with a complete lack
of fuss or excitement, but with proper attention
suited to their state. Warmed, washed, fed, they soon
fell again into the orderly course of the life that she
had arranged. She condoled with them on the misadventure
that had kept them prisoners on the hill-top,
and troubled no more about the matter, as soon
as she had made certain that neither of them had contracted
chills or colds. Very tiresome she felt the
misfortune to have been, but a thing that might have
happened to anyone, of no real lasting importance.</p>

<p>Not so, however, moved the keen mind of Minne-Adélaïde.
That astute woman, ruffled by the inexplicable
absence of her host, depressed by the barbarism
of the view from her window, and at all times prone
to the more passionate interpretation of life’s problems,
set herself to the careful watching of Kingston
in his relations with this strange new cousin of his
wife’s. Mrs. Mimburn from the beginning was no friend
to Gundred. She could not but suspect that Gundred
disapproved of her. No persuasions could induce
Gundred to call her ‘Minne.’ To Mrs. Mimburn’s
complete disgust, the new niece persisted in calling
her ‘Aunt Minna.’ Thus predisposed against her
hostess, Minne-Adélaïde unfavourably noted all Gundred’s
limitations, her apparent coldness, her lack of
appetizing brilliancy, of appeal, of all the many attractions
with which a wise wife arms herself against the
inevitable satiety of marriage. In an evening’s space,
Mrs. Mimburn became convinced that Kingston must
be dreadfully bored by this unsalted wife of his, with
her frigid little excellencies. She kept a sparkling eye
wide open for complications. When she heard that
Kingston was on the hills with a female cousin, she
smiled in one corner of her mouth; when time went
by, and he was discovered to be spending the night<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
with her on a mountain, she smiled in both, and licked
her lips with a delightful foreboding of catastrophe.
She welcomed her nephew with perfunctory joy when
he at last appeared, and devoted her keenest attention
to the examination of Isabel. And at once her experienced
glance discerned what it had taken Kingston
weeks to discover, what Gundred was still a long way
from discovering. She saw that Isabel was attractive&mdash;illogically,
unreasonably so, but attractive all the
same&mdash;even unusually so. And Minne-Adélaïde knew
that it is just these illogically fascinating people who
do the most harm, and establish the most devastating
tyranny over men’s roving tastes. ‘Aha!’ thought
Minne-Adélaïde. Time began to hang heavy on her
hands, and she fell to scanning the future with a hopeful
anticipation.</p>

<p>The days passed by in their usual lethargic orderliness.
Nothing happened, nothing seemed likely to
happen. Kingston and Isabel were rather better
friends than before, perhaps, but Gundred was so clearly
satisfied with the situation that no perils appeared to
threaten. Minne-Adélaïde began to grow a little disappointed.
Neither Kingston, Isabel, nor Gundred
gave her anything to be interested in. Their behaviour
continued merely amiable and ordinary. Perhaps
Kingston had grown more ardent in his treatment of
Gundred, but Mrs. Mimburn was not in a position to
realize the fact. Certainly he grew daily more and
more affectionate; he pulled her perforce into every
conversation, he devoted himself to her comfort, he
never allowed himself to be happy out of her sight.</p>

<p>As for Isabel, he and she had very little to say to
each other in these few ensuing days. What had
happened had happened; it had given them a blessed
consciousness; there was no need to be putting it into
words. Exhausted by emotions, they were content to<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
let themselves drift. That the situation was terribly
unsafe and precarious Kingston knew in his heart.
He realized that it could not long be continued. But
for the moment he acquiesced, and trusted that, before
the strain broke in catastrophe, Fate might provide
some solution; and, meanwhile, there was nothing for
Minne-Adélaïde to get hold of.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn had made herself into one of those
women who belong to the town, and are quite out of
place in the country. Her dress, her voice, her every
movement suggested the perpetual neighbourhood of
shops, and an habitual dependence on their resources.
Paris and London spoke in her, and she looked garish
and inappropriate whenever she carried her elaborate
boots or her silk petticoats into the country. Her
rustic clothes and hats were never genuine. They
overdid their effects, and only succeeded in looking
like those of an actress at a garden-party on the stage.
Mrs. Mimburn’s soul was as urbane as her body and
its appointments. She could not live or breathe for
long in the country. A nice suburban corner like
Surrey might be all very well for a week-end or so. It
had a saving artificiality&mdash;motors and bridge-parties
and all kinds of gaieties seemed quite in place. One
could wear decent clothes, and yet be in the picture.
A civilized landscape like that was nothing more than
a good <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise-en-scène</i> for an added last act to the
“Drama of the Season.” Mrs. Mimburn could tolerate
such an atmosphere without beginning to sigh for Bond
Street. But Ivescar, dumped in its desolation, was
nothing short of appalling. Minne-Adélaïde withered
and shrank. She bitterly regretted that curiosity had
brought her there. Nothing to do, nothing to see,
nothing to say: only clouds and rocks to look at, and
the rain for ever spotting one’s hat, and midges biting
one awfully through the openwork of one’s stockings,<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
if ever one went out on the lawn in a presentable shoe!
Minne-Adélaïde looked restlessly round for any possibilities
of amusement. She felt completely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépaysée</i>,
out of her world, an exile in a desert that made her
most brilliant gowns seem blatant and tawdry. She
grew homesick, feverish, overexcited by sheer weight
of dullness. She would not go away till she had well
spied out the land. But in the meantime she must
have something to do&mdash;or die.</p>

<p>‘So fascinating, your cousin,’ said Minne-Adélaïde
one afternoon, suddenly wearied of counting the raindrops
on the window-pane.</p>

<p>Gundred looked up from her needlework.</p>

<p>‘Isabel is quite attractive,’ she replied, her tone
implying, ever so faintly, that it was a presumption of
Mrs. Mimburn even to praise a Mortimer.</p>

<p>The two women sat alone in the picture-gallery,
Kingston being gone on some errand to his mother,
and Isabel writing letters upstairs. Of late days Gundred
had begun to notice the increasing warmth of her
husband’s nature, and in some strange way his affection
seemed to set her at a distance from him instead
of bringing him nearer. Though she had never thought
twice of his night on the mountain, yet the faint chill
that she had felt that evening had never since quite
left her. She could find no fault in their relations,
could guess no limitation in himself or her; yet now
his love seemed to leave her outside his life. She felt
cold and lonely&mdash;quite without reason, she knew, but
yet cold and lonely she felt. Therefore she was more
than usually on the defensive against the impertinences
of Minne-Adélaïde.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn noticed the implied snub.</p>

<p>‘Dear Kingston has a lot to say to her,’ she went on
viciously. ‘He always has such a lively mind. He
likes people with plenty of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élan</i>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>‘Doesn’t he&mdash;yes?’ replied Gundred quietly, yet
feeling the stab as she would certainly not have felt it
a fortnight ago. The skin of her self-contentment was
wearing thin. But she saw the other woman’s intention
to hurt, and brought all the resources of her pride
to repel the attack. ‘Isabel and my husband are the
greatest friends,’ she went on. ‘I am so glad of it.
She can talk to him about so many things. Sometimes
she can amuse him better than I.’</p>

<p>Her whole splendid pride shone in the calm with
which she made these admissions. It was her crowning
confession of faith in her husband. And yet, as she
made it, the confession hurt her. Deep down in some
secret place of her heart it touched a little hidden
wound.</p>

<p>Minne-Adélaïde saw only the rebuffing self-complacency
of the speech, and was spurred to angry indiscretion
by her niece’s arrogant tranquillity. ‘So
wise you are, dear Gundred,’ she said, ‘to let them
go about so much together. Now so many young
women ride their husbands on the curb, and end by
boring them to death. Not that your system has not
got its dangers, dear. I wonder you are never anxious.
Men are men, when all is said and done, and at your age
you cannot be expected to know the horrors they are
capable of.’</p>

<p>Gundred gazed across at her husband’s aunt with
cold grey eyes.</p>

<p>‘You have probably been unfortunate in your experiences,
Aunt Minna,’ she replied. ‘Everything
depends on the set in which one lives&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn laughed&mdash;a high, giggling laugh, with
a clever upward run at the end.</p>

<p>‘Nothing, my child&mdash;nothing,’ she replied. ‘All men
are alike under the skin.’</p>

<p>Gundred had a flash of cleverness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>‘But the skin may be clean or dirty,’ she answered,
‘and that is what makes the difference&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘Life, my dear,’ said Minne-Adélaïde sententiously,
‘is a garden of roses growing in manure. You cannot
play about in that garden without getting dirty.
And men like the gardening work, and they don’t
trouble to put on gloves for it either. Life is a dirty
affair, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma petite</i>.’ Minne-Adélaïde honestly thought
so, though her own life had been plain and clean in the
most uninteresting degree, so far as its facts went.
Gundred looked at her with chilly distaste. She misunderstood
Mrs. Mimburn, thought her attitude genuine,
instead of mere pose, and disliked her accordingly.</p>

<p>‘We shall never agree,’ she answered. ‘We see
things very differently, Aunt Minna. We have always
known different sorts of people.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimburn bit her enamelled lip. ‘Well,’ she
answered, ‘I am sure I hope you will make a success
of your life, dear Gundred. I do think the experiment
is a little risky, though. Isabel is really a little
dangerous, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Are you talking about my cousin?’ asked Gundred
loftily. ‘Oh, please don’t trouble. I think we understand
each other.’</p>

<p>‘No woman understands any other woman when
there is a man in the case,’ replied Minne-Adélaïde.
‘Only misunderstandings happen <em>then</em>. We are all
cats together. One always has to be careful of other
women.’</p>

<p>‘How kind of you&mdash;yes?’ said Gundred; ‘but there
is really nothing to warn us against.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma chère</i>, of course not. Dear Kingston is
the best husband in the world. It is a pity, perhaps,
he was not&mdash;well, a little more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noceur</i> before he
married. That would make one feel so much more
secure of him as a husband. One has to remember, you<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
see, that marriage is not only a matter of&mdash;obvious
things. It’s not a case of having a man, but of holding
him. A woman should always have reserves and spices
in her nature to keep her husband on the alert&mdash;ordinary
women, I mean. But you are so brave.
You are trying to run a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage à trois</i> on quite original
lines&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘My dear Aunt Minna, there isn’t any need to give
me so much good advice. I have no wish to interfere
with my husband’s amusements.’</p>

<p>‘Not even to have any share in them? Now, that
is so courageous. Of course you don’t seem able to
amuse Kingston as much as Isabel can. I suppose you
see that. He makes it plainer and plainer every day.
Or perhaps you simply don’t care for the trouble, and
so you give him a lively pretty creature to fill up the
time with? So sweet of you. I only trust he won’t
fill up the time so well that he won’t have any left for
you. Men are so uncertain.’</p>

<p>This time Mrs. Mimburn had pierced Gundred’s
armour. Her colour deepened. ‘I should think it a
silly insult to have any doubts of my husband,’ she
answered. ‘And&mdash;and&mdash;well, it’s not as if Isabel
were very extraordinarily beautiful.’ She regretted
the lapse as soon as she had committed it. But Minne-Adélaïde
pounced mercilessly.</p>

<p>‘Let me tell you,’ she said, ‘if Isabel is not exactly
beautiful, she is something much worse: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elle est pire</i>.
She is fascinating. Now, mere prettiness is apt to get
very <em>fade</em> and insipid after a time&mdash;the monotony of
marriage, you know. And if there is anyone so attractive
as Isabel anywhere near, a man is terribly ready to
forget mere prettiness.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps, but a gentleman does not forget his duty,’
answered Gundred, losing command of the situation
for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[205]</span></p>

<p>Minne-Adélaïde pursued her advantages accordingly.
‘Oh, well,’ she laughed, ‘if one only wants to
hold one’s husband by his duty! And even a gentleman&mdash;what
else is he but a man, as soon as his clothes
are off? And they do show the strangest forgetfulness
at times. <em>I</em> could tell you stories.’</p>

<p>Gundred hated herself for permitting such a dialogue.
Mrs. Mimburn seemed to have entrapped her.</p>

<p>‘Please don’t,’ she answered. ‘These things are not
interesting.’</p>

<p>‘You see,’ went on Minne-Adélaïde, ‘if one lets one’s self
slide out of a man’s life, one is encouraging him to
forget one&mdash;and to remember other people, which is
worse. Now you&mdash;of course one can’t always fill
one’s husband’s life, one can’t always talk to him, can
one? Between ourselves, now, one can’t always
understand him. And she does, this cousin of yours.
And that may be all right, or, again, it may be all
wrong.’</p>

<p>Thus baited, Gundred grew furious. Her colour
came and went, her manner became neater, cooler,
blander than ever. And yet she could say so little.
Mrs. Mimburn’s darts had found the weak spot that she
was hiding even from herself. Through all her anger
at Minne-Adélaïde’s insolence, the dialogue had for her
a fearful, poignant interest that forbade her to follow
her own first angry instincts, and cut it off with a
snub.</p>

<p>‘I think you are quite mistaken,’ she replied. ‘And,
anyhow, I should always be glad to see my husband
being amused&mdash;no matter who it was by.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you have the reckless unselfishness of the very
young,’ answered Minne-Adélaïde intolerably. ‘That
has wrecked so many marriages. “Trust nothing and
nobody” ought to be one’s motto, and do all the amusing
that may be necessary one’s self. It is safest in the<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
long run&mdash;if one can do it, that is. However, you seem
content to let someone else do it, and all I say is that
I hope no harm will come of it. But when you want
to take up your own position in your husband’s life
again, you may find that someone else has filled it
while you were ordering dinner and talking about the
weather. It is even better, my dear, to bore your
husband than to let him find that he can be kept amused
all day and every day by someone else. I should get
rid of the cousin, if I were you.’</p>

<p>‘Yes?’ answered Gundred, gelid with wrath,
yet, despite herself, enthralled in Mrs. Mimburn’s
dreadful foreshadowings. She began to have some
notion what it was that she had been finding unsatisfactory
in her relations with Kingston. He petted her
more and more, but more and more did he talk to Isabel,
and his recent efforts to include Gundred only revealed
his inability to do so. This it was, this situation of
her own making, that had been giving her secret, unacknowledged
qualms, and feelings of vague hunger.
The more proudly, then, did she revolt against Mrs.
Mimburn’s insinuations, and the vigour of her anger
was the measure of her inward conviction that the
insinuations held some truth.</p>

<p>Minne-Adélaïde thought that she held Gundred helpless.
She presumed on her power, made reckless at
once by boredom and by gratified spite.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well,’ she pursued, ‘it may pay to leave your
husband for ever alone with Isabel. I can’t say. It
wouldn’t pay with any other man or any other woman.
But, of course, your husband <em>may</em> be an exception.
Most husbands are&mdash;to their wives&mdash;until the catastrophe.
Now, if I were you, I should want to know a
great deal more about that night they got lost on the hill
together&mdash;or said they did. That sort of thing isn’t
done, you know. It wants a good deal of explaining.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>Confronted with the final insult, all Gundred’s pride,
the best side of her courage rallied to her aid. Her
manner betrayed no agitation, paid Mrs. Mimburn no
compliment of excitement. Perfectly cool and level
was her voice as she looked up and answered:</p>

<p>‘You seem to forget that we are not living in one of
that dreadful man’s plays,’ she said. ‘I should despise
myself if ever I were capable of having such thoughts of
my husband or my cousin. As you said just now,
such things are not done&mdash;in the class I know, at all
events.’ She fixed a cool, contemptuous, grey stare
on the astounded Minne-Adélaïde, who suddenly had
an unaccustomed feeling of getting the worst of it.</p>

<p>Fluttered by this sudden revolt, Mrs. Mimburn
made an effort to recover lost ground.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry you take it like that,’ she began. ‘Of
course one does not mean to accuse&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘We will talk of something else&mdash;yes?’ said Gundred
very coolly, but with complete decision.</p>

<p>Minne-Adélaïde gasped. She considered her attitude
towards life all that was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</i>, up-to-date, and
sound. She imagined that no man or woman could
ever spend the dark hours in each other’s neighbourhood
without the ultimate disaster, and piqued herself
on the smart knowledge of the world that discerned
adultery in the most casual compliments. Gundred’s
sudden revolt was preposterous in its ignorance of
human nature, as well as supremely insolent in its offhand
condemnation of her own views. She completely
lost her temper.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well,’ she said, ‘one has to remember how little
you know of things, poor dear! Your innocence is
really beautiful&mdash;if it weren’t so pathetic. You will
have a rude awakening one of these days. I am afraid
there can be no doubt that your husband has
already&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>She broke off, daunted by the look in Gundred’s
eyes. The immemorial pride of the Mortimers gleamed
and flashed in them. Gundred might have been
brought up to be calm, unemotional, well mannered,
but she came of a race that had never allowed itself to
be baited by inferiors. And almost everyone else in
the world was an inferior. Gundred fixed a chilling
stare on Mrs. Mimburn’s excited face. ‘Be quiet,
please,’ she said; ‘I am afraid you are a very vulgar
woman.’</p>

<p>All was over; Mrs. Mimburn was summed up and
condemned in that one placid sentence, so judicially
delivered. She could make no appeal; for the life of
her, she could not even finish her remark. For the
moment she was dominated by the force that came from
her rigidly decorous enemy.</p>

<p>Then in the silence, the door opened, and Kingston
entered. Gundred turned towards him with a happy
smile.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it a pity,’ she said in pleasant, gentle tones.
‘Aunt Minna says she must go back to London to-morrow.
Nothing can persuade her to stay, I find.’</p>

<p>Minne-Adélaïde stuttered and choked with wrath
at this defeat. ‘Yes,’ she said, purple through her
powder&mdash;‘yes&mdash;yes, I must positively go back to town&mdash;positively
go back to town to-morrow.’</p>

<p>Gundred quietly resumed her work.</p>

<p>Minne-Adélaïde was gone, but her work remained.
A week had passed, but Gundred could never forget
that dialogue. Still as far from her mind as ever was
any crude distrust of her husband. It was not in her<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
nature to have vulgar suspicions&mdash;to attribute to others
that ugly baseness of which she herself could never have
been capable. But, none the less, she grew vaguely
fretted by Isabel’s presence, vaguely unhappy over the
interest that Kingston took in her cousin. The two
were always saying things that Gundred could not
understand. Bit by bit she grew to feel that even to
be an efficient housekeeper and a nice, well-dressed
person is not always quite sufficient for a wife’s endowment.
She made spasmodic attempts to follow Isabel’s
flights into the abstract, and sometimes gave a book
the preference over needlework. Her conversation
became ambitious, aiming at brilliancy, but only achieving
flatulence. She talked in capital letters, of high
big words without definitions. Her contributions to
ethical debate were windy, wearisome, perpetually
circular and pointless. She saw that she could not
attain to Isabel’s fantastic lightness of touch; she
tramped a heavy ring of argument, and, being for ever
unable to analyze her own meaning, was quite incapable
of conveying it to others. Never before had she
found herself inadequate. Now the conviction grew
upon her that inadequate&mdash;at least, in some directions&mdash;she
certainly was. She took refuge in the consciousness
of her wedding-ring, and in the thought that
impiety would be involved in the sharing of much
that her husband and Isabel talked of. And for no
possible consideration of earthly happiness would
Gundred have wished to share impiety.</p>

<p>Kingston and Isabel noticed Gundred’s efforts to
keep pace with their conversations. On Isabel they
had no effect. Isabel admitted no consideration of
Gundred to any place in her life. She lived alone with
Kingston, in a world of their own creation, and Gundred
had for her little, if any, real existence. On
Kingston Gundred’s manœuvres impressed the full<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
ill-luck of the situation. He saw how she was trying
to come near him, and her struggles to do so only emphasized
the fact that she was far away. Her attempt
had come too late. Understanding now, as he did,
the relation in which his whole soul stood to Isabel’s,
it became piteous to watch Gundred’s efforts, and
understand their futility. He redoubled the warmth
of his demonstrations, and, after the habit of men,
tried to make up for denying her what she wanted by
lavishing upon her everything she did not. Outward
signs no longer satisfied her; she had awaked to the fact
that true marriage involves the exchange of something
more, and that something more it was not now in Kingston’s
power to give her. He was delightfully attentive,
delightfully demonstrative; he picked up cushions,
placed footstools and pillows, fetched and carried with
eager docility; he complimented, praised, gave lip-worship
and kisses and embraces; but these vigorous
manifestations were all so many simulacra of the love
that was lacking. Gundred insensibly came to realize
the lack, and Kingston’s well-meant attempts to dissemble
it only had the effect of forcing it on her attention.
He gave her no cause to feel lonely, was always
at her side, always included her in the talk, never
allowed himself to be alone with Isabel. Yet lonely
Gundred still felt herself&mdash;shut out from something.
By whose fault? The fault was undiscoverable.</p>

<p>Her husband’s attitude was negative and balanced.
He threw all his efforts into making good to Gundred
the fraud that he had innocently perpetrated. He
had no need to look at Isabel, to talk to her, to aggravate
the trouble of Gundred’s position. To Kingston
and Isabel their secret glory was glory enough. He
even shrank from the idea of open friendship with the
woman whom his heart loved. It was enough&mdash;completely,
triumphantly enough&mdash;that she should be<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
there in the same house with him, and that he should be
for ever conscious of her presence and her relationship
to himself. That relationship might have been profaned,
spoiled, made common, had they allowed themselves
to indulge in talk, in rapture, in the perilous
delights of intimacy. As things were, it remained a
lovely secret possession, a thing between them both,
silent and holy, not to be brought down to earth.
The earthly agonies had passed, or only recurred for
fleeting moments. The privilege of keeping sacred a
feeling so absorbing was enough for the glorification
of the present. Morbid and perilous, the situation
stood. A month would probably have destroyed its
frail balance. In the nature of things it could not
last. No sane lover could have contemplated its
lasting. But Kingston and Isabel had no plan. They
lived from hour to hour; they did not dare to look
forward. Destiny would somehow loose the knot of
their relations. Silent love was enough for the
moment. Their emotions hung breathless on a delicate
poise that would not let them contemplate any
to-morrow. Besides, such a transcendental attitude,
so dangerous, so unpractical, so deadly, left Kingston’s
nature free to pay consolatory court to Gundred.
With all his external nature he did homage to his wife,
and concentrated his skill on paying in full to Gundred
the debt he owed. Exalted and fantastic, rather than
sensual and practical, his temperament made the task
easier than it might have been found by many better,
more full-blooded men. To him it became rather a
fine martyrdom, in the successful achievement of which
lay not only purification, but even pleasure. In the
mutilation of the lower self for the sake of the higher
he found a comfort so keen as to be almost joy.</p>

<p>Thus, in eager self-mortification, he humbled himself
before Gundred, and believed that she had no<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
suspicion of any defaultings on his side. He felt that
he was giving her good measure, pressed down and
running over&mdash;though only of the second-best. That
she guessed it to be the second-best her husband had
no notion; so subtle an instinct would always have
been beyond the prosaic Gundred whom he had
known and married. Now he knew her no longer;
life had developed them along different roads. So
he continued in the confident hope that he was giving
her the perfect satisfaction to which she had the right,
while she, for her part, secretly chafed at his obvious
efforts, grieved that effort should be necessary, and
exerted herself more and more to enter his life again.
And as for the future, that might look after itself.
Sufficient to the day was the marital duty of it.
Marriage, however, is a dead thing by the time it becomes
a duty. Kingston had no suspicion of this,
but Gundred, suddenly outstripping him in the race
of intuitions, understood in her heart of hearts, and
felt a mortal chill.</p>

<p>The habits of a lifetime, though, are not easily
broken by emotional gales; Gundred, for all her leaping
excursions into the regions frequented by Kingston
and Isabel, retained her old, well-drilled enthusiasm
for domesticity. Hearts might break and sunder, but
the trained courage of Gundred saw no reason why
soup, for that, should grow tepid, or beds ill-aired.
Whatever she might fear or suffer, however much she
might strain and agonize for real intimacy with her
husband, she could not have excused herself to herself
for allowing her attention to wander from his comfort
or neglect his health. She pursued the useful tenour
of her way with a Spartan cheerfulness that might
have been even more splendid than it was had not
long habit so engrained in her the zeal of domestic
services. She continued overhauling the house, its<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
resources, its supplies, its deficiencies. Lady Adela
having handed over to her the reins of government,
she assumed them with unfaltering grip. Soon she
became the housekeeper’s terror, and put to rout
all the slack ease that had prevailed under the ineffectual
amiability of her mother-in-law’s rule. While
one side of her nature was battering for admittance
into Kingston’s life, the other, the older, larger side,
was occupied in examining store-cupboards, choosing
wall-papers, pulling the house and its appointments
into shape once more. Many improvements must be
made, lighting remodelled, some of the worst horrors
tactfully but decisively obliterated.</p>

<p>And at this point, some ten days after Kingston’s
understanding with Isabel, her inquiries brought
Gundred face to face with the revelation that the
drains of Ivescar were of an Early Victorian Tudor
design no less pronounced than the style of its architecture.
The discovery filled her with consternation.
Her husband had confessed the day before to a sore
throat. Diphtheria at once painted itself grimly on
her imagination. Their stay at Ivescar must immediately
end. With a strenuous exertion of character she
swept Kingston and Isabel into harmony with her own
determination, and the next morning they fled from
Yorkshire. There was only one place for them to go
to while the sanitary inspectors got to work. The
London house was impossible&mdash;a desolation of painters
and builders. They must return to Brakelond. Accordingly
to Brakelond Gundred carried her acquiescent
flock, and they took up their residence once again in
the little wooden wing that jutted out over the sea.
And so three more days passed, drifting Kingston and
Isabel insensibly nearer to the inevitable catastrophe.
In their fantastic ecstasy they were heedless of peril.
But without some intervention of fate their path led<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
downwards towards disaster, though they might
ignore or angrily deny the fact even to themselves or
each other.</p>

<p>At Brakelond some of the old reflected strength
came back to Gundred. She became, once more,
rather the châtelaine than the glorified housekeeper.
Her mind, less distracted by congenial cares, was able
to devote itself with all its might to what she called,
to herself, the recapture of her husband. She talked,
claimed his attention, attempted metaphysical flights.
Her efforts aroused in him sad laughter, irritation, and
pity. They were tragically futile as ever&mdash;futile in
the very nature of the case, no less than in the limitations
of Gundred’s character. The situation drifted
on and on. As for Isabel, Gundred not only tried to
copy her methods, but to monopolize her company.
She sat with her, took her for drives, kept her at her
side as much as possible, flattering herself all the time
that her manœuvres were imperceptible. Isabel,
secure in her secret supremacy, allowed herself to be
captured, and, in the superficial victory of Gundred,
found an added joy in her own hidden amusement.</p>

<p>‘A little drive this afternoon&mdash;yes?’ said Gundred,
after lunch. ‘Wouldn’t it be nice? You will come
with me, Isabel?’</p>

<p>Isabel assented. ‘At what time?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Oh, four o’clock. I don’t want to go far. There
is a woman I rather wished to go and see. Dear
Mary Restormel, Kingston, you have often heard me
speak of her. They have been friends of the family’s
for I couldn’t say how long.’</p>

<p>‘Shall I come with you?’ asked Kingston, not
fancying the back seat of the victoria, and hoping to
be excused.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, dear. You had better sit in the garden
and make yourself comfortable. We shall not be<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
away long. Restormel is only about two miles off
across the valley. And we’ll take the new horse too.
So I expect we shall be home again in next to no
time.’</p>

<p>‘What does one talk to Mrs. Restormel about?’
asked Isabel.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’ll do that,’ replied Gundred, not admitting,
even to herself, that her motive in taking Isabel was
to prevent her from having Kingston to herself that
afternoon. ‘I really want to see her. She is expecting
a child in about a month, dear Mary Restormel.
Such a mercy if it is a son&mdash;not that it will make any
difference, I am afraid, for the place will certainly have
to be sold as soon as poor Hugh Restormel dies. Such
a cruel pity&mdash;the sweetest little old place, Isabel.
But the Restormels are poorer than Church mice
nowadays, and positively cannot keep it going for
another generation. You will simply love it, Isabel;
you will be able to wander in the garden and get lost.’</p>

<p>Expressing her joy at the prospect, Isabel made her
escape to get ready.</p>

<p>Kingston and Gundred were left together.</p>

<p>‘You are quite sure you will not be lonely, Kingston,’
said Gundred, after a pause. She spoke with a tinge
of remorse in her voice, reproaching herself with painful
conscientiousness for her wish to deprive him of
amusing company.</p>

<p>‘Oh no,’ he answered, not discerning her veiled
apology, nor caring to. ‘I shall get along quite
happily.’ He no longer answered her as he might have
done in his first innocent friendliness, before Isabel had
been revealed to him.</p>

<p>Gundred noticed the difference, with a subtlety for
which he would not have given her credit.</p>

<p>‘It is so nice having Isabel with us&mdash;yes?’ she said,
apologizing both to himself and her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[216]</span></p>

<p>Her husband had long since ceased to criticize
Isabel; now he warmed honestly to her praise.</p>

<p>‘She is splendid company,’ he replied. ‘Always
full of interesting things to say. Don’t you think she
is very amusing, Gundred?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes,’ answered Gundred with pathetic insincerity.
‘So bright and witty and facetious. I often
wish I could say all the clever things she does. I am
afraid I am much slower than she is, though. My
brain does not run along so readily. I am fonder of
serious things.’</p>

<p>Her voice was touched with a faint wistfulness.
Kingston hardly noticed it. He saw an opportunity
for a show of that ardour which she found so unsatisfactory,
and which he believed that she found so
satisfying.</p>

<p>‘She is one person, and you are another,’ he replied.
‘I would not have you different, little lady, for anything
in the world.’</p>

<p>This was pleasant and pretty. Gundred’s instincts
found it blankly empty and chilling. He meant to be
so warm, but a month ago such an advance as hers
would have been very differently met. Then he had
thought her cold, had been for ever calling upon her
to thaw. Now he hardly appeared to notice whether
she was warm or cold, despite his manifestations of
enthusiasm. Now it was he that was frozen, and she
might thaw, it seemed, in vain. Had her melting come
too late?</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t you?’ she answered slowly. ‘Are you
really sure you wouldn’t? Kingston,’ she went on in
a low voice, ‘I do so want to do and say what you
like.’ She hesitated and broke off, seeking piteously
for words that should salve her pride in its downfall.</p>

<p>He could not understand that her seriousness demanded
the tribute of a serious answer in return. He<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
gave her another of those easy protestations which
sounded so well, and yet, as she felt, meant so little.</p>

<p>‘You always do,’ he replied, ‘always and always.
You can’t tell how much pleasure you give us, Gundred.’</p>

<p>Against this geniality, so smooth, so superficial, she
felt horribly powerless. There seemed no way, any
longer, of piercing to her husband’s notice, of spurring
him up to sincerity. And that casual ‘us’ shut the
door against her so finally.</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ she answered in a tired tone, her smile tinged
with tragedy. ‘You say such delightful things. But
I do feel I am not clever enough for you.’</p>

<p>‘It is not cleverness one wants,’ he said. ‘It is
just you. You, and only you. You are exactly
perfect. One doesn’t criticize and say you are not
this and that. You are just You.’</p>

<p>She knew that he no longer criticized. But what
he thought loyalty she felt to be lack of interest. The
ardour of his words awoke now no answering ardour of
conviction in her mind. As for Kingston, an emotion
of pure pity stirred him. This charming, dear little
woman, how awfully much, after all, he owed her.
He believed that he could only pay his debt to her by
redoubling the formal warmth of his words. The
more pitiable he found her, the more he intensified the
eagerness of compliment that was his atonement at
once to her and to himself, that eagerness which she
found so void and cold. ‘Dear pretty lady,’ he said,
‘you should never have foolish little doubts. Don’t
you realize that nobody’s husband was ever so happy
in the world before?’</p>

<p>She knew it. And she feared that she counted for
nothing in that happiness of his. Her hands dropped,
her voice grew chilly in its hopelessness. ‘Such a
comfort&mdash;yes?’ she answered. ‘I am glad you are
so happy, Kingston. I hoped you would be.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>Isabel came back into the room, and in a moment
an animated conversation was going forward. Gundred
took her part bravely, speaking wherever speech was
possible, always falling short or wide of the point,
always on the edge of giving up the attempt, and
always being picked up by her husband, and pushed
back again into the dialogue. Then the carriage was
announced, and she set off with Isabel to visit the
Restormels.</p>

<p>Kingston sat in the garden, pondering the strange
situation, hoping that he was behaving fairly to all
concerned, and believing that he was. What could
come of it all he had no idea. Poor Gundred, he admired
her, respected her, marvelled at her&mdash;did everything,
in fact, but love her. And that was now beyond
his power. Love he could show, love no one can force
himself to feel. She no longer stirred any pulses of
emotion in him. She was a mere acquaintance&mdash;a
pretty, charming, well-mannered acquaintance, but
nothing more. What could he do, except what he was
doing? To send Isabel away would be to find himself
soon ceasing even to tolerate his wife. Without Isabel
his life would become vacant and boring beyond conception.
And it was not possible but that his boredom
would react unfavourably on his attitude towards
Gundred. It was fairer to all that Isabel should
remain with them, easing off the tension of the difficult
situation. And in time everything would settle down
somehow, and the problem of existence would solve
itself. He would not look ahead. Ten days had
passed in a dream of holy happiness. Why not ten
months, ten years, ten lustres?</p>

<p>Meanwhile the return of the two women was
strangely delayed. Tea-time came and went without a
sign of them. And then the agitating news arrived
that the new horse had emphasized his novelty by<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
bolting on the homeward way, and upsetting the
carriage at the foot of the hill leading up to the Castle.
Gundred was unhurt, and soon appeared, pale and
shaken, but intrepid. As for Isabel, her leg had been
badly broken.</p>

<p>The next few hours passed in ceaseless bustle.
Isabel, unconscious, was carried up to the Castle.
Doctors, nurses, medicaments were wired for. Gundred’s
courage came nobly to the fore. Despite the
shock she herself had sustained, she went calmly, self-denyingly,
self-importantly about her business. Kingston,
who had seen nothing and suffered nothing of the
accident, was far less placid and level-headed than
Gundred. The sight of Isabel appalled him; Gundred
firmly faced the responsibility, had her brought to the
oaken parlour at the end of the old wooden wing, did
all that could be done for her till the doctor arrived.
When Isabel returned to consciousness it was Gundred
who watched over her, comforted her, tried to mitigate
her pain; Kingston could not bear to contemplate the
horror. Had the sufferer been a man, Kingston, perhaps,
might have confronted his groans more stolidly,
though even so his sympathetic, emotional temperament
must always have been less fitted than Gundred’s
cool, unimaginative bravery, to cope with the manifold
uglinesses of physical suffering.</p>

<p>At last, however, the telegrams began to bear fruit.
The doctor arrived, and matters showed signs of
settling down into a more regular train. The bone
was duly set, Isabel made comfortable, and hope
held out of a speedy and prosperous recovery. A
nurse came, and proved a very capable and decisive
young person, whose only weakness was for looking-glasses.
She was established in the empty upper
rooms of the old wooden wing, and gave nightly scandal
to the Castle servants by lighting all the candles she<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
could get together, the better to contemplate her
charms and curl her hair. Except for this trick of
collecting so lavish an illumination and leaving it to
take care of itself while she went about her other
businesses, she turned out both pleasant and useful.
Her charge soon grew to like her, and, within a day or
two of the accident, life at Brakelond was subsiding
once more into calm and comfort. Helpless Isabel
lay in state in the little oaken parlour, where Kingston
and Gundred kept her company, hardly leaving her
alone from morning to night. There was even, as her
recovery satisfactorily advanced, a certain quiet charm
about this invalid life. Isabel incapable of movement
was rather a softer, more human person than
Isabel insolent in perfect vitality and health. Kingston
and Gundred enjoyed sitting with her and talking
to her. They took it in turns to read aloud, and did
everything they could to make the victim’s imprisonment
as bearable as possible.</p>

<p>So the days went placidly by till, though she was as
yet, of course, unable to set foot to ground, the doctor
promised that before long she might expect to be
getting about once more, without any ill-effects from
her accident. The nurse’s position, relieved by
Gundred’s assiduities, grew more and more formal,
more and more of a sinecure. She spent most of her
time among the servants in the Castle, and her own
looking-glass saw less and less of her. There were
her morning duties and a few routine services to be
discharged later, but in the evening, when Isabel had
dined, she could safely be left to the care of Kingston
and Gundred, while Nurse Molly, her fringe in perfection,
could go and delight the housekeeper’s room
away in the Drum Tower.</p>

<p>The conversations between the three over Isabel’s
bedside took many a strange turn. Gundred was never<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
encouraged by either Kingston or Isabel to feel any of
her inability to take an adequate part. They chatted
of everything that interested them, and Gundred was
compelled to believe herself interested also.</p>

<p>‘Now that the pain is over,’ said Isabel one night,
‘one wonders, looking back, what it was all about&mdash;what
it meant, what it really was.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, they always say a broken bone is dreadfully
painful,’ replied Gundred. ‘I have always heard so&mdash;yes?
Dear Isabel, you bore it so bravely.’</p>

<p>‘One has to worry through,’ rejoined Isabel. ‘But
what I meant was, why is the pain there? What
makes a cracked bone produce all the unpleasant
effects it does on one’s consciousness. It sends all
kinds of horrible little burning, grinding, stabbing
messages of spite to the brain. That is what pain is.
But what are all those little messages for? Why
does the beastly bone go on repeating itself so? If
it only told the brain once and for all that it was
broken, that ought to be quite enough. I hate a
tautologous bone.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Kingston, ‘but it only goes on sending
those messages when your brain tries to disregard
them. Your leg only hurt when you tried to move it.
Pain is simply the repeated warning of Nature.’</p>

<p>‘And the test of endurance&mdash;yes?’ put in Gundred.
‘Pain has the most marvellously elevating effect.’</p>

<p>For a moment the conversation lapsed. They were
sitting in the oaken parlour after dinner. The hour
was growing late, and soon Nurse Molly might be
expected to come and shut up Isabel for the night.
However, at present she was at the other end of the
Castle, taking her pleasure with the rest of the household,
and the old wooden wing, with its inhabitants,
was left quite deserted.</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe it,’ said Isabel. ‘Pain is absolutely<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
horrible. I am a coward about it. I loathe and dread
it altogether. Pain and death&mdash;dying, rather&mdash;are
awful to me. I love being alive and warm in the blessed
world. Dissolution is ghastly. For nothing would I
give up the joy of living. Oh, agony is too horrible.
It’s not a lesson so much as a punishment. Oh yes,
a punishment, even if it’s for something one has done
hundreds of years ago, before one was in this body
at all.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, what a dreadful idea!’ cried Gundred, shocked&mdash;‘a
terrible unchristian idea!’</p>

<p>‘Not at all,’ contributed Kingston; ‘what about the
blind man in the Temple? They asked Christ, “Did
this man sin, or his parents, that he was born blind?”
How could he have sinned, then, before he was born,
except in some other existence? And Christ passed
the question. If He had disbelieved the theory of
reincarnation, He was quite capable of saying so very
definitely. But He did not. By His silence He implicitly
admitted its truth, instead of challenging it,
and devoted Himself to the healing of the blind man.’</p>

<p>‘So wonderfully hot it is in here to-night,’ said
Gundred.</p>

<p>‘I always feel,’ went on Isabel, ‘whenever I have a
bad time, I am paying for having enjoyed a too good one
once in a wrong way. I expect this broken leg of mine
is the result of some selfish enjoyment of mine in bygone
days that I have forgotten. I had prepared this
penalty for myself in some mysterious way. For
these things come automatically. Touch a button&mdash;commit
the tiniest, wee-est action, good or bad&mdash;and
years and years later, long after one has thought the
action dead and forgotten, something happens that
shows it has been alive and steadily working from
the first hour to the last. Every littlest thing that
happens, pleasant or painful, can always be traced back,<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
I expect, to some cause, infinitely small and infinitely
remote in the past, far, far away beyond one’s recollection.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you wonder,’ said Kingston, ‘what your
actions of yesterday and to-day will produce, and how
long it will be before their effects come down upon us?
We shall probably have forgotten all about to-day by
then, but everything that we have done must bear
some sort of fruit some day or other, as you say. Your
accident, for instance, will have some effect upon us,
and Nurse Molly must make some change in our lives,
sooner or later. If one cannot introduce a fresh action
without effect into our lives, still less can one introduce
a fresh person. Nurse Molly, with her marvellous
fringe, will certainly bring some new element with her
into our lives. Now, what will it be, Isabel?’</p>

<p>Gundred saw a chance of being apposite.</p>

<p>‘Talking of Nurse Molly,’ she said, ‘really, she must
be terribly vain. Morgan tells me she lights all the
candles she can get together, and then sits and looks at
herself in the glass. The servants are perfectly scandalized.
And when she goes away from the room, she
never dreams of putting the candles out. She leaves
them all burning quite happily, and never thinks about
them again. Such a sinful waste&mdash;yes? And she
might set these old wooden rooms on fire any day, by
her carelessness.’</p>

<p>Isabel ignored her cousin’s intervention, and went
back to the original topic. ‘I hope,’ she said, ‘I have
atoned for my wickedness of the past with this broken
leg of mine. What I want to do is to lay up for myself
a great fat store of merit, so as to go on getting happier
and happier in all the later stages of my existence.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but before one can attain the perfect happiness,’
replied Kingston, ‘remember that one has to
lose the desire for it. After ages and ages of purification,<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
one leaves the last trace of desire behind&mdash;even
the desire for good. Then one becomes the perfect
knowledge which is the perfect peace.’</p>

<p>‘So dreadfully chilly it sounds&mdash;yes?’ said Gundred.</p>

<p>‘Well, but the warmth of life is also the torment of
life,’ replied Kingston. ‘Desire may be as warm and
pleasant as possible, but all desire is sorrow. Without
desire there is no disappointment, no suffering, none
of the horrible things in life that we all want to get
away from.’</p>

<p>‘Would one rather sacrifice desire for the sake of
getting rid of sorrow, or is desire so pleasant that one
would put up with sorrow to retain desire? I suppose
desire is very painful and all the rest of it, but it does
make life wonderfully interesting, and one’s days would
be deadly lonely without it.... I don’t know that
I want the perfect peace, as yet, Kingston. Perhaps
when my soul has grown a few centuries older. At
present all I want is to lay up for myself a supply of
happiness to go on with.’</p>

<p>‘You can only do that,’ he answered, ‘through
suffering&mdash;self-abnegations, martyrdoms, and all sorts
of uncomfortable strenuous virtues. By despising
pain and bearing it for others, you may attain to
happiness. Not simply by sitting quiet and saying
you want to acquire merit. You must go through
dreadful things cheerfully if you hope to lay up merit.’</p>

<p>‘Nothing for nothing is the rule, evidently,’ said
Isabel, ‘in morality as well as in commerce. So tiresome,
when everyone longs to get bargains, and buy
a pound’s worth for half a crown. But when happiness
comes to the hammer, it always fetches its full
price, I suppose, in whatever market you buy it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Gundred, what do you think?’ asked
Kingston.</p>

<p>‘Talking of hammers,’ replied Gundred, ‘there are<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
the strangest thumpings going on upstairs. Don’t
you hear? Hammerings and bumpings and knockings.
Do you think Nurse Molly can be nailing up pictures?’</p>

<p>‘Running pins into the fringe, I should think,’
replied Kingston, with a touch of petulance. Certainly
Nurse Molly was making the oddest noise in her room
overhead. In the silence that followed Kingston’s
suggestions her unmethodical clatterings could be
distinctly heard.</p>

<p>‘We must certainly ask her to be quiet&mdash;yes?’ said
Gundred. Then she rose and went to the window.
‘Why should it be so stifling in here?’ she went on.
‘There is quite a gale outside. Only listen.’ She
paused, and the roar of a great rushing wind was
clearly evident.</p>

<p>‘The wind seems to get up very suddenly on these
coasts,’ said Kingston.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes,’ answered Gundred; ‘all in a minute.
Especially so late in the year. That is what makes
the heat so extraordinary.’ She peered curiously out
into the darkness. ‘Why, Kingston,’ she exclaimed,
‘it is actually snowing. How perfectly astonishing!
Quite a number of snowflakes are falling. And Nurse
Molly’s illumination is really too scandalous; I can see
it glowing quite far out into the night, throbbing and
flickering.’ She pulled back the catch, and threw the
little window wide.</p>

<p>Instantly, from above, a long, keen shaft of pure
flame curled swiftly down into the room, licked round
the casement like a dragon’s tongue, and was gone
again. Gundred had self-possession enough to close
the window, then she staggered back. The roaring
sound overhead was louder now than ever.</p>

<p>‘The Castle is on fire,’ she remarked at last, after a
heavy pause. Suddenly she felt elated by her sagacity.
‘The Castle is on fire,’ she repeated slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>‘I think we had better get out of this,’ said Kingston.
‘It’s that woman’s confounded candles upstairs.
Ring the bell, Gundred, will you?’</p>

<p>He went to the door, and opened it. The passage,
their one hope of reaching the body of the Castle, was
an impassable mass of flame at its further end. Kingston
came back into the room. Even now the full
horror of the situation had not struck him.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid we can’t escape that way,’ he said quietly.
‘The corridor is ablaze.’</p>

<p>Gundred, meanwhile, was vigorously pulling at the
bell; in the silence that followed Kingston’s announcement
she continued methodically at her task, and the
knob could be heard slapping again and again into its
socket as she released it.</p>

<p>Kingston glanced from Gundred to Isabel.</p>

<p>Isabel had said nothing hitherto. He waited poignantly
to hear what she would suggest.</p>

<p>At last she spoke. Her voice was strained with
agony and terror.</p>

<p>‘And I&mdash;I cannot move,’ she said. ‘I am tied by
the leg.’</p>

<p>Kingston turned furiously upon Gundred, who, in
an access of vain frenzy, was rending and tearing
the bell.</p>

<p>‘Leave off making that hideous row!’ he exclaimed.
‘What do you suppose is the use of it? Do you
imagine the servants will come through three yards of
fire to get us out?’</p>

<p>‘What are we to do?’ asked Gundred feebly.</p>

<p>‘I’m hanged if I know,’ replied her husband. ‘We
must do something, that’s certain, and pretty quickly.
These old rooms will burn like tinder. There must be
some way along outside.’ He looked out of the farther
window. Now the clamour of the fire was growing
every moment more insistent. The night air was<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
aglow, and burning fragments were dropping like
meteors towards the sea beneath.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Kingston. ‘There is a little ledge of
rock. One couldn’t walk along it in the daytime,
but we have no choice. Gundred, you will have to
do what you can. You will be able to get along quite
safely, if you go quickly and don’t think about it.
And I must take charge of Isabel. Isabel, I’m afraid
it won’t be very good for your bad leg, but I must
carry you somehow. And there is no time to be lost.’</p>

<p>Then Gundred understood everything. In the
midst of an orderly comfortable life, it is not easy to
understand that one is suddenly hemmed in by inexorable
death. But at last the facts of the situation
all burst in a shrieking pandemonium upon Gundred’s
brain. She faced round upon her husband, read his
face, and knew suddenly what terrible thing it was
that he was thinking. In that awful moment of
unveiled sincerity she saw that she, his wife, came
second in his consideration. She was to get away as
best she could. It was Isabel that mattered. The
slow secret fears of her life roared out into the open,
swept down upon her in a storm, and culminated.
She clasped her hands for self-control, as the world
shook and tottered round her. Desperately she
clutched at her escaping senses; then, in a swirl,
everything rushed together, grew dark, vanished.
She dropped her hands, gave a sharp, moaning cry,
and fainted. In the blank silence that followed her
fall the voracious bellowing of the fire drew closer and
fiercer.</p>

<p>‘My God!’ said Kingston, in the low tone of absolute
terror, ‘what are we to do now?’ He looked at
Isabel. Between the two helpless women he must
make his choice. He must make it instantly, too.
He could not by any possibility save both. He<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
looked again from Isabel to Gundred. Isabel’s face,
in that supreme hour, was white and wet with anguish,
but she said nothing. She saw too well what Gundred’s
collapse involved. Kingston still stood glancing
from one to the other. He knew which of the two his
whole soul cried aloud to save; he knew also which of
the two his duty called on him to save. Love and
duty were at last impossible to reconcile. On the
razor’s edge of agony his mind poised and quivered
through a pause that seemed to fill whole delirious
hours, yet was come and gone in a flash. Insensibly
he was waiting to hear Isabel pronounce his sentence
and her own. All her passionate love of life shone in
her straining eyes. They implored him, called upon
him, cried violently to him for safety. And then, in
an instant, Isabel’s eyes were opened, and her soul
rose triumphant on its wings.</p>

<p>‘Your wife,’ she said, with dry lips, almost inaudibly.
‘Your wife. You must save her. Go&mdash;go
quickly&mdash;and then come back for me&mdash;if there is
time&mdash;oh God, come back for me quickly.’</p>

<p>All was over. He knew he must obey. Without
a word, he turned and gathered up the inanimate
bundle that was Gundred. In feverish haste he
clambered with his burden through the window.
Insatiably, terrifically, the fire raged and ravened
overhead. As he went he had a last glimpse of Isabel,
her face gleaming with fear, set in the strain of mortal
anxiety, her white hands clenched and writhing
together on the quilt. Then he was out in the darkness,
with brands and lumps of burning matter falling
thick about his ears, drifting down into the night, to
sink at last, hissing, into the invisible sea below.
Stumbling, tottering, staggering, he dragged his load.
How he ever reached safety he could never have told.
A hundred times it seemed as if he must fall. But he<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
struggled on vaguely, half-consciously, through a
nightmare, and found himself at last on sure ground,
under the shelter of the old Castle walls. Savagely he
dropped his unconscious burden on a level spot, then
turned to rush back for Isabel. And, at that moment,
before his bloodshot eyes, the old wooden wing collapsed
into a blazing hell of fire&mdash;a vomiting pyramid
of sparks and flame.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>


<p>The soul passes in a moment from youth to manhood,
through the iron door of a great sorrow. Between past
and present stands the bolted portal, and the event of
half an hour has set an eternal barrier between the
thing one is and the thing one was. Kingston Darnley,
as soon as his dazed brain began to understand what
had happened, found that he looked back at his past
across the haze of fire as on a drama played by strangers.
Everything had changed; on that drama a curtain of
anguish had descended, and now, when it lifted, the
scene had altered, and the old actors had disappeared
for ever. Kingston, no less than Isabel, had passed
through the furnace. Seared and burned and blackened
he emerged from it, changed beyond his own recognition,
with passions killed and passions kindled. Somehow,
by some mysterious help, he had struggled through
the agony, and come out alive; but his consciousness
was dazed and bruised, his vitality crushed, his fiery
interest in life turned suddenly to the grey ashes of
mere endurance.</p>

<p>The days went by in a dreary dream. Kingston
went mechanically about his duties, and saw the
figure of Gundred moving at his side like something
unreal and strange. There were inevitable activities<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
for him to carry through, and he discharged them
steadfastly, with his numbed mind fixed on other
matters. As for Gundred, not having so suffered,
she found herself more alive to the matters in hand.
There were condolences, inquiries to answer, arrangements
to be made, restorations to be seen about.
Gundred’s interest in the details of life could never
lie long dormant, and when the first shock had passed
with two or three days of intermittent tears, Gundred
dried her eyes carefully, with a due regard to their
appearance, and began to pluck up her sense of importance
once more, thanking Heaven for her powers
of self-control.</p>

<p>The fire had confined itself to the old wooden wing
and the chapel, and had made no attempt to devour
the stark stone walls of the Castle itself. Gundred
was deeply grateful for the forbearance thus manifested
by Heaven, and was soon immersed in plans for the
rebuilding of the ruins. Her husband, stupefied and
calm, was not yet able to give her any effectual help,
and so on her unaided shoulders she triumphantly
supported all the responsibilities of the case. As time
passed, and her first outbreak of genuine sorrow was
quelled by the flood of her new activities, Gundred even
began to enjoy the importance which events had so
abruptly conferred upon her. Suddenly she became
more conspicuous in the public eye than ever in her
life before. The tragedy of Brakelond challenged
attention and pity up and down the length and breadth
of England. In horror, in picturesqueness, in romance,
it possessed all the titillating qualities best fitted to
make it the talk of the country. And Gundred became
the central figure of the picture; sympathy and admiration
were concentrated on her; her courage, her coolness,
her grief, her rapid resumption of self-control, were
made the daily subject of laudation. Of her husband<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
nobody knew much, or cared. Her own name, her
own position, made her the pivot of the drama, to say
nothing of all the other causes that had tended to
obscure Kingston since the catastrophe&mdash;his dazed
acquiescence in events, his reluctance to enter the
world of new plans in which Gundred was moving so
happily. He sank into the background, and was
alone with his sorrow.</p>

<p>Gundred was busy with designs for the new stone
wing that should arise in place of the treacherous old
wooden fire-trap, as soon as the ruins should have been
cleared away. Kingston could be moved by nothing
except the hope of finding Isabel’s relics. It was not
till the third day that his wish was fulfilled. Then,
buried in the densest chaos of débris, they found what
remained of the dead. Gundred cried bitterly over
the tragic discovery, and then, dabbing her eyes,
began to meditate an epitaph that should compensate
everyone for all that had been suffered. Kingston
faced the piteous remains in a stupor. He could not
have told what it was that he had expected the excavations
to reveal, but surely nothing so crude as this
mere wreckage of mortality that came to light. The
fire had been merciless: a few fragments of flaky bone,
the blackened crust of a skull, from which the white
teeth gleamed horribly&mdash;this was all that it had left
of Isabel. Kingston could never have anticipated the
raw ugliness of the revelation. It stunned him anew.
This black, bare globe was dreadful, filled with dreadful
thoughts and associations, a monstrous burlesque of
love and things lovely; its eyeless glare, its obtrusive
grin, were ghastly in their mockery of life’s beauties;
the glitter of two gold-crowned teeth in the lower jaw
set the last fine edge on the horror, in their ironical
reminder of the daily life now destroyed for ever.
And yet this was Isabel&mdash;the real Isabel&mdash;or, rather,<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
it was the earthly emblem of her. That rounded shape
had actually contained her, had contained the hopes,
the fears, the love that had gone to make up Isabel.
And now, where and what was Isabel? Only the outward
form had suffered; how could the mysterious
secret passions that had been the framework of her
personality, how could they have any share in the
ruin that had fallen on the outward manifestation of
Isabel? And yet, without that outward manifestation,
how could she still be Isabel? Dimly, fantastically,
he tried to figure her in another shape&mdash;as another
woman, as a man. The task was impossible. To his
bounded human outlook, the outward form was an
integral part of the real Isabel. Yet, now he was
brought face to face with the obvious fact that, while
the outward form had been reduced to a thing of
loathing and horror, the real Isabel must still be in
existence somewhere, incorrupt and incorruptible. It
was unthinkable that she should have suffered the fate
of her body. So he must perforce bring himself to
realize that the thing he loved had had no true connection
with the hair, the skin, the features that it
had worn for a while. Hair and skin and features
were gone; but the beloved remained&mdash;out of sight,
unrecognisable, remote; yet, for all that, perfect and
unalienated. Fire could not touch the heart that was
Isabel, the courage, the loyalty, the devotion that were
Isabel. They were still alive as ever. But where, in
what far world, how to be found again, and how to be
known again when found?</p>

<p>Kingston passed insensibly beyond the cheap
materialism of orthodoxy. He could not postulate
an infinite gilded space where Isabel might be eternally
walking in her habit as she had lived on earth. This
invincible anthropomorphism, this obstinate survival
of the savage in us, by which we are all prone to imagine<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
the dead as we saw them in life, and familiar for
ever by their earthly features, had now no hold on
Kingston. He knew that, whenever we may meet
our dead again, and wherever that may be, heart will
call to heart, and soul be known again to soul; but the
features that we have known and loved, the bones, the
flesh, the softness, will all have passed long since into
other forms of life, merged in the huge kaleidoscope of
the universe. Perhaps, in circumstances less cogent,
he might have conceived himself as meeting the physical
Isabel years hence in some glorified state, yet recognisable
to eyes that had known her on earth. The
sight of her relics, however, jarred him once and for
all out of the puny, materialistic dream. The blackened
hideousness of them forced on his attention the
irrelevance of all physical forms. For a time they may
be everything, these forms and features; ultimately
they go for nothing, pass utterly, are dropped, discarded,
alike by the love that wore them and by the
love that worshipped the spirit they clothed. No, he
had done for ever with the corporeal Isabel. Weaknesses
and beauties of shape were all destroyed, reduced
to their native insignificance. Yet Isabel remained.
But he had lost her; she had passed beyond his knowledge
into dim places where, if ever she heard the cry
of his soul far off, she could not make him any answer.
Now and then, perhaps, she might call to him in return;
in the whisper of the evening wind, in the song of a bird;
but never again in the accents he had known, from the
lips that he had watched; and, even so, she might
call unceasingly to the hungering ears of his soul, yet
never be able to make them understand whose voice it
was that they heard. His deep certainty that she still
lived made the separation more paradoxical, more
horrible than ever to Kingston. To know that she
was there, yet to call in vain; never to see her, never<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
to meet her, to be unable, through all his days, to open
up any means of communication with the thing he
knew to be still existing,&mdash;this was the ghastliest instance
of Fate’s irony, giving so much, yet making the
gift so nugatory.</p>

<p>Kingston began to feel that, after all, the bill sent in
by the gods had fallen more heavily on him than even
on Isabel. Isabel had passed through agony to glory.
But he, he had another agony, longer and more incurable
than hers, though less poignant; and no glory to compensate,
at the end, for the gnawing persistence of his
pain. The grey, sad merit of doing his drudging duty
by the world for two or three more score of years&mdash;that,
perhaps, lay before him; but a chilling, colourless
glory was this, at once harder and less rewarding
than the sudden flare of martyrdom through which
Isabel had passed upwards on her way. For upwards
she had gone, leaving him henceforth alone on the lower
levels where they had first met. Isabel&mdash;selfish, passionate,
barbarous Isabel&mdash;in one whirling moment had
leapt above all the trammels of false desire and fear&mdash;had
soared into the great heights of selflessness, and
left far beneath her the outworn husk of her old
struggling egoism. In that other state where she now
went radiant, it must be another Isabel that lived and
moved&mdash;a purified Isabel, stripped of many mean and
selfish thoughts; an Isabel far nearer than before to
the ultimate radiance towards which the whole world
is inevitably tending through ages of slow purification.
How should he even be able to catch up lost ground
and come level with this glorified Isabel once more?
And yet, again, without features&mdash;without the well-remembered
features of body (without so many of the
mind’s well-remembered features too)&mdash;how, even if
chance should be given, was he to recognise the soul
that had once been one with his own?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[235]</span></p>

<p>She had utterly outstripped him in the race. No
test of his endurance could equal that test of hers&mdash;no,
not if he lived decently and honestly all his days,
doing the best he could with his duty through the
lagging years that probably lay ahead; why, that
would be nothing to compare with her ordeal, no such
swift burning furnace as that through which Isabel
had passed, and from which she had emerged all gold
in the sunlight of her future.</p>

<p>Because duty and honour had seemed to call, he had
sacrificed the thing he loved for the thing he had
promised to love. Even in cold blood he would still
have done the thing&mdash;must have done it; any other
course would have been impossible, a treason, a
horror. But the sacrifice had been a rending of the
heart; his whole soul was strained and bleeding from
the wrench&mdash;bleeding to death, he thought. And,
while Isabel had won freedom for herself, he had gained
nothing but a lifetime’s loneliness. Without any
peddling notions of striking a bargain with the gods,
he could not but feel the sarcasm of their smile. He
had sold his life’s happiness&mdash;to buy a lifetime’s unhappiness
and desolation. He had done what was
an agony to do, in order to obtain that which would be
a long agony to endure. So he looked angrily, contemptuously,
on the chilly duty and self-respect which
was all that his martyrdom had gained him. He
hated them for what they had cost, and hated them the
more for his inmost knowledge that the purchase
had been inevitable. Life without Isabel! It seemed
that his soul had never in all the ages imagined the
possibility of such a thing, yet now he was to envisage
it through every remaining day and hour of his existence.
She was gone, rising on strong wings towards
heaven; he remained on earth, alone for ever, he who
had so helped her take her flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>So time dragged by, and insensibly the first agony
of his loneliness wore down into a calmer sorrow.
Isabel’s bones were duly buried, and honoured with a
neat inscription devised by Gundred, and matters
gradually began to fall into a settled course once more.
Kingston began to return to ordinary life, and his
private grief no longer claimed his whole attention.
Between himself and Gundred a barrier still rose, but
he grew able to give her his help, and, bit by bit, to
share once more in the superficial interest of her days.
She, for her part, went bravely on her way; with more
courage and on a more difficult way than she or anyone
else suspected. The new wing was built; the
new wing lost its raw look of novelty; gradually Isabel
and her end became to Gundred little more than a
vague if awful memory. She was not the kind of
woman whose nerves can be thrown permanently out
of gear. Self-restraint had been drilled into her blood
through many generations, and she made imperturbability
the test-virtue of good breeding. Only once in
all her life had perfect coolness failed her, and that
one momentary lapse had been the immediate cause of
Isabel’s death. For a long time the knowledge of this
was her secret cross. In her heart of hearts, that last
awful instant had showed her that Kingston loved
Isabel, that his care for his wife was mere loyalty.
The sudden perception, the combination of new terrors
and responsibilities had been suddenly too much for
her endurance, already sapped and damaged by hidden
anxieties and by the shock of the accident. Not
meaning to be selfish, transported rather with the
longing to be unselfish and give up her own life that
her husband might save Isabel’s, she had yet, in the
crisis, helplessly committed the final selfishness. She
had killed Isabel. Nothing at first could quite excuse
her to herself. And she knew that her husband must<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
inevitably feel as she did. This was the barrier
between them&mdash;Gundred’s innocent guilt, and Kingston’s
answering knowledge that she, and she alone,
had been the real cause of Isabel’s death. Her weakness
had cost him the happiness of his life. How
could he bring himself all at once to look on the poor
woman with a cordial eye? He could not but bear
her a grudge&mdash;all the more bitter that he realized how
unintentional had been the cowardice that had had
such terrible results. He guessed, in his inmost consciousness,
that Gundred&mdash;cool, practical Gundred&mdash;would
have wished to be no less heroic than Isabel,
would have wished to sacrifice her own life to his happiness;
and this instinct only aggravated his grudge,
only intensified in its first vigour his aching, bitter
grief that the sacrifice had not been achieved or made
unnecessary by a brief exercise of Gundred’s usual calm.
Yes, the death of Isabel stood between them for a while
like a sword of fire.</p>

<p>But Gundred was not a woman to suffer exaggerated
scruples. Soon she surmounted the shock, and
Bellowes’ Hypophosphates enabled her to triumph
over morbid qualms. She reflected on the goodness
and honesty of her intentions, set remorse in the background,
and ere long was facing Kingston without any
more such distressing reserves. He, meanwhile, was
also growing quieter and more sane in his views. After
all, no one was guilty. Everyone had acted for the
best. Nature was not to be blamed. He was too fond
of his wife to go on condemning her for an instant’s
lapse. He saw the hysterical injustice of his grudge
against her, and in time succeeded in overcoming it.</p>

<p>Though neither knew it, Isabel’s stormy intervention
and terrible exit had tided them over the difficult
preparatory stage of wedlock. Now that she was
gone, they gradually settled down together in that<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
elastic bond of mutual tolerance which promises so
well for permanent peace. Neither any longer expected
too much from the other. Kingston grew to
acquiesce in Gundred’s limitations, and rejoice in her
perfections, without feeling fretted by the one or
satiated by the other. He did not ask her to be an
intellectual companion, to talk, allure, amuse. She
was always cool and pretty to look at, always cool and
pleasant in temper, an admirable hostess, housekeeper,
and friend, altogether level and satisfying as a companion.
He had had enough of vain searchings for
the ideal. Nothing could divorce him from the memory
of Isabel. He carried it with him from day to day,
shrined in the depths of his heart, and through the
placid duties and happinesses of his life never ceased
to worship that lost part of himself, and yearn for its
recovery. But on the surface he wore a face of
perfect contentment, and his marriage with Gundred
soon subsided into a whole-hearted alliance that was
put to no strains, that stood the wear and tear of
intercourse, and was felt to be quite ideal by all that
had the privilege of watching it. And Gundred, now
that the storm was over, gave equal allowances to her
husband. The time was gone by now for high
emotions and anguish. Her dim jealousy had vanished
with its cause, and she no longer pined for the perfect
intimacy that her nature made it impossible for her
to attain. Instead of being in love with Kingston,
she was now devoted to him, served him loyally and
piously, made it her pride to keep him comfortable and
contented. She divined in what quarter her strength
lay, and took pains to cultivate all the qualities that
gave her a hold on her husband. She learned life’s
lesson, grew accommodating instead of exacting,
prayed for him instead of preaching at him, and
pressed upon his acceptance nothing that he did not<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
want. The years had worn down the sharp corners
of their characters in the mill of marriage, until at
last their harmony was exact and without any
apparent possibility of discord.</p>

<p>The years glided placidly by, bringing no more
great or violent developments into the lives of
Kingston and Gundred. Five years after the fire at
Brakelond Gundred bore a son, but otherwise little
occurred to break the monotonous tenor of their days.
Isabel, by now, was almost forgotten. Only Kingston
retained his faithful worship of her, cherishing it
secretly, far down under the loyal surface of his life,
feeling that justice allowed him at least so much of
compensation. From day to day he longed for her
and listened unceasingly for some far-off echo of her
voice. It seemed almost as if she had never been,
as if she had left no relic of her existence in the world&mdash;except,
perhaps, by a quaint freak of fortune, in the
life of that Mrs. Restormel to whom Gundred had
taken her on that fateful visit. For Mrs. Restormel,
overcome with the horror of the news from Brakelond,
had been so excited that her hour had come upon her
unawares. Out of due time she had been delivered
of her child, and a boy had made his appearance in
the world only twelve hours after Isabel had quitted
it. However, the Restormel baby prospered and
grew strong, was christened by the family name of
Ivor, and passed successfully through the vicissitudes
of childhood. Otherwise, as Kingston Darnley felt,
Isabel had come and gone, leaving no other trace in
the world than that persistent image which her life
had established in his own soul.</p>

<p>The restless heat of youth had died down in
Kingston as in Gundred. His son was growing from
boyhood towards manhood. Unnoticed the years had
flowed away till almost a quarter of a century had<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
rippled by since the passing of Isabel. He himself
was growing fixed and solid; grey was developing
itself in his heart as in his hair. Life was very level
and very comfortable and very pleasant. It was no
longer stimulating. As for Gundred, the years had
less effect either on her nature or on her appearance.
She was one of the women who neither shrink nor swell
with age. She had not grown fat; she had not grown
thin. Possibly she had dried up a little. The freshness
was gone from her features, though not their neat
prettiness. They had grown perhaps a trifle wooden
in their clear and rather hard perfection. Tiny lines
had drawn themselves here and there, especially round
the mouth. Otherwise her face had changed wonderfully
little. The alteration was in its spirit rather
than in its form. It was still strangely young for its
years, but now it was far more decisive than before,
older in experience, more matronly, more righteous.
All her points had intensified, and now she had turned
from a very pretty bride to a very pretty wife, full
of responsibilities well borne, of interests, charities,
benevolence. Her child, her schools, her households,
her Primrose League gave abundance of occupation to
her life, and more and more for her growing sense of
excellence to feed on. From duty she never flinched
or flagged; the consciousness of such undeviating
rectitude of practice gave her manner a commanding
air of self-confidence. Religion, too, tightened its
hold on her. The better she felt herself becoming, the
more useful and valuable, not only in herself, but as an
example of conduct, the more her intimacy with
Celestial Persons grew. Priggishness, self-conceit, as
well as all the other grosser mental errors, were very
far from the well-balanced security of her nature. The
worst that an enemy could have said would be that
she was a little slow to admit the possibility of any<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
limitations in herself. In earlier years she had
already been calmly self-confident. Time had only
justified and reinforced the calm as well as the self-confidence,
so she went her methodical way, a model
for all matrons, and had, in the neat garden of her
life, no disorderly plots, no tangles, no weeds. It was
a precise arrangement of well-kept beds&mdash;everything
in its place, and no profitable herb omitted. Her
husband wandered outside its borders, and roamed
the shrubberies of freedom. But Gundred found all
that her nature ever needed to ask in that daily round,
that common task for which her character had been so
perfectly fitted by time and fate.</p>

<p>Their life oscillated between London, Ivescar, and
Brakelond. In London Gundred had her factory girls,
her hospitals, her educational societies; at Brakelond
there were the tenants to be looked after, the Castle
and all its immense organism to be managed, the Tory
Candidate to be upheld by threats of Gundred’s withdrawal
of her custom from all who should so far presume
upon the Ballot as to oppose him. At Ivescar there
were farms, gardens, parishes to be controlled by
Gundred’s masterful eye. For a masterful eye it was.
Kingston slid back into himself, never regained his
full vital energies, renounced interest in his career,
and yielded the reins of government into his wife’s
hands. As her sphere widened, and her power increased,
Gundred’s unquestionable majesty increased
proportionately, until the habit of ruling had grown
so strong in her that no one would have presumed to
doubt the wisdom or cavil at the commands of that
tranquil little despot, whose voice was never raised in
anger, whose orders never admitted the possibility of
dispute. She arranged the lives of all around her
with the serenest certainty, and indomitably shepherded
her army of dependents, factory girls, tenants, and<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
servants along the path of righteous happiness. As
mistress she was a success; as a hostess the same
strenuous qualities, the same self-sufficiency brought
her the same success. She could never hold a room
by her talk, but she could now listen graciously, and
disguise her complete inattention by smiles. Clever
people went willingly to her houses in London and
the country. Her well-dressed, pleasant presence
made a becoming quiet background for their conversation,
and, as a housekeeper, she was unsurpassed.
She never rivalled their efforts, she never failed to make
them feel both clever and comfortable. A brilliant,
ambitious woman could never have won the popularity
that Gundred’s calm indifference achieved. If
not gay, her set was clever and solid, nor did anyone
ever discern that it was only her well-bred stupidity
that had had the gift of gathering it round her by
sheer force of apparent colourlessness and calm.</p>

<p>Gundred loved the power that her position had
attained, and, as time went by, Fate also was kind,
and gave her that full measure of glory which had been
denied to her earlier years. London had ignored the
inconspicuous Miss Mortimer, unmarried, and slenderly
portioned. But London showed itself very amenable
to the charms of Lady Gundred Darnley, conspicuously
wealthy, and with Brakelond as well as Ivescar at her
back. For the old Duke faded away at last, and
Gundred’s father reigned in his stead&mdash;a mild and
inoffensive reign, which left all real dominion to be
exercised by his daughter. For the new Duke, like
his predecessor, had slid into a gentle imbecility, and
now lived at Brakelond in contented seclusion;
Gundred occupied the house as mistress, vigorously
took up her father’s responsibilities, and was, to all
intents and purposes, the tenth reigning Duchess of
March and Brakelond. She never went in to dinner<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
after a Marchioness without feeling that such an order
of precedence was altogether paradoxical and out of
joint. For was she not herself a Duchess in everything
but name?</p>

<p>Her constant energies overshadowed her husband
in the public eye. By the side of his energetic practical
wife he spent a peaceful existence very much alone,
very little hampered by the more brilliant cares in
which Gundred took such pleasure. She could not
push him into any prominent position; he had lost, in
an hour, all stir of ambition, and preferred to live on
in the company of his dreams and memories and
visions. Their son was his great delight, his most
constant occupation. Gundred was a trifle too multifariously
busy, a trifle too excellent to be a perfectly
sympathetic mother. It was to his father that Jim
Darnley carried all his more interesting private matters
for sympathy and discussion. Kingston, as the years
brought him increasing calm, found his world growing
narrower, till at last it held only his son and his
memory of that strange intoxicating passion which had
ended on so terrific a final note at Brakelond more
than twenty years ago. His heart still clung to the
far-off thought of Isabel, and his life was always in
some mystical sense alert to catch news of her in the
shadowy lands where she might now be dwelling.</p>

<p>Kingston could never bring himself to feel that Isabel&mdash;the
real Isabel, as distinct from the body she had
worn&mdash;was dead; he knew that she still lived, somewhere,
somehow; he felt it in every fibre of his life;
every nerve vibrated with the knowledge that somewhere,
in some remote corner of the world, that lost
half of himself was still alive. As the years passed his
ideas, instead of growing fainter, grew keener, more
fixed, more certain. He lived in mysterious expectation
of a call, the sound of a voice he should recognise,<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
some hint that Isabel had come back, that their paths
through the world had crossed again. Sooner or later
the call would come; it was impossible that it should
not. He and Isabel were so close together; accidents
like physical death could not be any permanent
barrier. As the time went by he grew more and more
sure that the call must come soon. Each day he
hoped that the sign might be shown to-morrow, and,
deep in his heart, listened in every conversation for
the sound of Isabel’s voice, and looked in every face
for a memory of Isabel’s. Meanwhile he lived out his
placid life, friends with all, popular, suspected no
longer of any eccentricities. The gentle, managing
woman at his side had never any notion that her
husband was cherishing such fantastic hopes. To
her he had long been, in reality, a stranger, a stranger
very dearly loved, and very faithfully looked after,
but a stranger none the less, as are so many of us to
those who love us best.</p>

<p>As for Isabel, if Gundred ever recalled her name now,
it was with a feeling of wrath that grew steadily
towards hatred. Isabel stood for the one moment in
which Gundred had faltered, in which she had not
been sure of herself. Isabel was a painful memory,
not only as recalling that far-off period of unrest, but
also as raking back into recollection that one awful
instant in which Gundred’s courage had failed her&mdash;with
results so disastrous for poor Isabel. Had the
results not been quite so disastrous for Isabel, Gundred
could better perhaps have borne the recollection. As
it was, they convicted her of inadequacy, and touched
her secret pride in its tender point. She pushed such
horrid reflections far back in the most private cupboards
of her consciousness, and hated Isabel anew whenever
accident compelled her to open the locked doors and
turn over those dreadful bones of her one failure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[245]</span></p>

<p>But Gundred had great skill in ignoring all unwelcome
topics; it was very rarely that she remembered
her cousin, and all the dim, remote unpleasantnesses
that Isabel represented. Her first year of married life
now loomed down upon her out of the distant past as
a confused nightmare-mirage of desert wanderings, from
which her nice tact and the favour of Heaven had
brought her feet at last out into the Canaan of prosperity,
conjugal and social. The few brief sorrows
of the past assumed gigantic proportions in the haze
of memory, and Isabel was their incarnation. Gundred
began to realise how directly Heaven had
intervened to relieve her of her cousin’s threatening
presence, and, though grateful for the service, it was to
her credit that she retained humanity enough to think
the means adopted unnecessarily drastic. This tenderness
greatly elevated Gundred in her own eyes. She
remonstrated with Heaven&mdash;not acrimoniously, indeed,
but with feeling, and devoted many prayers to Isabel’s
happiness in another world. But she rejoiced over
Isabel’s removal from this, and nothing could have
given her serenity a greater shock than any suspicion
that her husband ever remembered the dead woman
with tenderness or longing. However, she was protected
from such perceptions as much by her own
impermeability to unwelcome truths as by her husband’s
perpetual skill.</p>

<p>He had not come so far through life, safeguarding
his wife’s happiness and trying to behave decently,
only to undo all the good by allowing her now to see
that he regretted Isabel. The course of years had
taught him to keep a shut mouth on all his aspirations.
His mind was apparently thrown wide for
Gundred, but Isabel’s shrine was hidden in the very
holiest of holies. As Gundred roamed through his
mind’s reception-rooms, comfortable and clean and<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
neatly decorated, she never had any suspicion of that
locked room in the very heart of his soul’s dwelling,
where the memory of Isabel was for ever worshipped.
Many of us, indeed, there are that keep a secret shrine,
but few of us suspect its existence in anyone else’s life.
Gundred was perfectly happy in her monopoly of her
husband, perfectly confident that she knew every
corner of his mind. He, for his part, gave thanks for
the salutary blindness which so often makes life tolerable,
and continued to make his wife a visitor in the
heart whose tenant was still the dead woman&mdash;the
dead woman whom he daily expected to meet again,
whom every hour brought nearer to the renewal of
contact with himself. He had done his duty, played
his part, abundantly paid Gundred all he owed and
could; affection, respect, loyalty&mdash;of all these he had
never failed for one moment to give her in good
measure; the secret impulses of his love could not be
controlled like their formal manifestations; no one
could exact it; not one could expect it. His own
inmost heart still yearned and cried for the return of
Isabel, that return in which every day made him more
firmly believe, more immediately look for.</p>

<p>For twenty years had Kingston Darnley awaited the
call that was to come to him from Isabel. He had
made no effort to anticipate, or even to summon, the
voice that he desired. It seemed to him better, finer,
more loyal, to do nothing, to sit patient until the
course of life should bring him again into touch with
what he had lost. At the appointed moment the voice<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
would reach him, and he would know it. But till
that time should come, his soul revolted against the
notion of going out into the devious byways of foolishness
to call up the departed with necromancy or any
other prevailing fad. For all such illegitimate dealings
with the third-rate dead he had the strongest contempt;
it would be a profanity to attempt such proceedings
in relation to Isabel; wherever she was, she
must be above those hireling spirits who go out in
attendance on séances and circles. So for many years
he maintained his resolution to be patient, and stiffened
himself in disdain of cheap and common spiritualistic
methods. He had no idea that people of any sense or
breeding could find solace in futilities so apparent.
Gundred was his standard by whom he judged all
other women’s pretensions; and Gundred had, not so
much a contempt as a rooted religious horror, immitigable,
medieval, of magic, palmistry, psychometry&mdash;all
the many names beneath which we disguise our curious
longing to pry behind the veil. The very notion of such
things made Gundred so piously angry that a certain
reluctant, stifled belief could be guessed to underlie
and inspire her denunciations. Meanwhile, however,
her attitude confirmed Kingston in his, and he remained
quiescent, until at last he came across Mrs.
Mercer-Laporte.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mercer-Laporte was dining with Mrs. Mimburn
when Kingston and Gundred met her, having accepted
their aunt’s invitation as a solemn but displeasing bi-annual
duty. Gundred made a point of never evading
it; Gundred made a point of never enjoying it. Minne-Adélaïde,
however, with the years, had grown less
flagrant; but the change made her no less odious than
before to Gundred, for her love of the illicit had now
turned from matters of the flesh to the darker mysteries
of occultism, clairvoyance, ghost-raising. She had<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
taken to frequenting circles, to entertaining phantoms,
to wearing weird, shapeless clothes, and collecting
round herself a crowd of people famous in the ‘psychic’
world. And of these Mrs. Mercer-Laporte was the
fine flower, the most exalted, the most spiritual, the
choicest in ways and manners.</p>

<p>She was almost obtrusively lady-like, tall and pale,
and mild and bland, in long trailing draperies of blue.
She had sweet anæmic features, and a watery eye that
suffused with tears on the slightest occasion. Her
hair was thin and sandy, coiled into a knob on the
top of her narrow head; her mouth was large, lax,
emotional; her glances soulful and celestial. She
wore a quantity of mystical-looking chains and necklaces
that gleamed and jingled as she languished from
place to place with a certain priestly elegance. She
fell to Kingston’s lot at dinner, and during the first part
of the meal he felt himself truly unfortunate. At
last, however, a chance word caught his attention and
held it.</p>

<p>‘Ah, my dear Mr. Merrington,’ he heard her saying
to her other neighbour in high dulcet tones&mdash;‘dear,
dear Mr. Merrington, believe me, I have often had the
sweetest converse with my dear dead.’ She sighed, as
if in rapture, while Mr. Merrington helped himself to
a cutlet in aspic. ‘They return to those that love
them, Mr. Merrington,’ she went on, as soon as the
cutlet had been safely landed. ‘I never feel that my
dear ones have been lost. They are always near one&mdash;it
only needs a suitable medium to produce them.
Oh, of course, I am not talking of silly common
séances. <em>Those</em> spirits are people one would not wish
to have anything to do with; but, ah! the sweet and
holy talks I have had with my own beloved ones in
suitable surroundings.’</p>

<p>At this point, seeing Mr. Merrington more favourably<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
inclined towards the cutlet than the conversation,
Kingston thought he might be allowed to take part in
the talk.</p>

<p>‘One always feels,’ he said, ‘that from all accounts
the spirits that return must be those of exceedingly
weak-minded people. The messages they make so
much ado about conveying are invariably such
rubbish.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mercer-Laporte turned the watery gleam of her
smile upon him. ‘What is matter?’ she asked hierophantically.
‘Ah, Mr. Darnley, what does matter
matter? Believe me, you have been unfortunate in
the spirits you have met. In the innumerable vibrations
of the Universe there are rays innumerable that
permeate the Whole with their blessed dew, and consume
in their pure radiance all the coarser manifestations
of matter. You speak without that inward higher
knowledge which makes us one with the Infinite, in
those far Universes where the Veil of matter exists no
longer, and the blessed dead are free and untrammelled
by any more cares of this vulgar flesh!’ Mrs. Mercer-Laporte
stopped to take breath, and in an abstraction
allowed herself to be given an artichoke. Then, while
she was unconsciously devouring it, Kingston took
advantage of the pause in her oration to recall her to
the question that interested him.</p>

<p>‘Then,’ he said, ‘soberly and without mistake, are
you really sure that we can ever converse with our own
friends in other states of existence?’</p>

<p>But Mrs. Mercer-Laporte made a profession of irrelevance.
In her world it was the hall-mark of wisdom,
the guarantee of occult knowledge to which the profane
crowd can never attain. She would not have lowered
her pretensions by sticking to the point.</p>

<p>‘Go,’ she said majestically, waving an inspired fork,
‘go to dearest Mr. Minch in Albany Road&mdash;49, Albany<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
Road, Mr. Darnley; Albany Road in Notting Hill,
remember. Go to him, Mr. Darnley, and be made
happy. How all of us, bound down in this sphere of
matter, how we leap and burn to attain the higher
levels through which for ever the blessed ones are
wandering on their angel wings! Ah, rapture, rapture,
Mr. Darnley! Go, go to Mr. Minch.’</p>

<p>Twaddling and silly as her utterances were, yet the
woman was obviously sincere. Kingston had never
met the type before, and now he saw that it was not
quite so cheap and contemptible as he had always
imagined. Predisposed by his secret longings, he
prepared to lend a favourable ear, and the dulled
sobriety of his middle-aged calm began to break up
unexpectedly into a St. Martin’s summer of youthful
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>‘What does Mr. Minch do?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Do?’ replied Mrs. Mercer-Laporte. ‘He draws
the pearl from the Secret Lotus! He will tell you
your heart’s desire. He will tell you of the sweet
spirits hovering round you. He can see them all
easily, and the colour of your own soul’s halo he will
tell you too. Sometimes it is pink and sometimes it
is blue. Mine,’ she added with pride, ‘is purple.
No one but me has a purple halo, Mr. Darnley. But
every one of us has a colour of our own, and dear
Mr. Minch sees them distinctly and clearly, and tells
you all about them, and about the dear spirits as well.
And then, if there is anyone among them, anyone in
the precious company of the invisible with whom you
particularly wish to enter into sweet converse, Mr.
Darnley, you might go on to Mr. Muddock at Hindhead.
Mention my name, though, just to show that you
have a reverend and faithful spirit. Mr. Muddock has
<em>the</em> most marvellous powers. He is more than a mere
psychometrist. He can actually make the dead<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
resume the garb of flesh, Mr. Darnley!’ perorated Mrs.
Mercer-Laporte with awful solemnity.</p>

<p>Suddenly Kingston’s resolve of twenty years weakened
and broke. The long odds were that this talk of
spirits was the mere nonsense he had always believed
it. But still there could be no possible harm in trying
to find out. And if, in sober truth, Isabel were really
hovering on the edge of the other world, perpetually
longing to enter into communication with him again,
how tragically foolish to neglect the blessed opportunity
because of any stupid materialistic qualm of
incredulity. After all, there might be something in it.
In the avowed belief that there was nothing, and the
secret trust that there might be a great deal, he
resolved that he would go and see the wonderful
Mr. Minch. He intimated his decision to Mrs. Mercer-Laporte.
The sibyl showed much mystic rapture.</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ she said, ‘sweet and holy, sweet and holy.
The blessed ones are waiting for you, Mr. Darnley, I
feel convinced of it. I almost think I see one near you
now, but alas, I have not quite reached the percipient
plane as yet. But do go to dear Mr. Minch, and he
will tell you her name and all about her, and what she
wants to say to you. I have had the strangest, most
marvellous experiences myself. My own sweet sister
Margaret is always hovering round me, Mr. Darnley.
She died when she was only six days old, and grew
up in the spirit world. I recognised her distinctly, as
soon as dear Mr. Minch described her.... Golden
hair, he said, tall, blue eyes, high forehead, graceful
figure. Then, to make <em>quite</em> sure, I said, “Does your
name begin with M?” and Mr. Minch asked the sweet
spirit, and told me it said “Yes.” Then, of course, I
knew. “Margaret,” I cried&mdash;just like that&mdash;“is it
Margaret?” And it <em>was</em> Margaret; she had come to
tell me that I must go on bravely, and everything<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
would come right. Now, wasn’t that a holy, happy
experience, Mr. Darnley? Oh yes, you must go to
Mr. Minch. Go to-morrow night at eight. He has a
public circle then, and crowds of dear poor creatures
go to him for help and comfort, and he heals them all&mdash;not
only people like you and me, Mr. Darnley, but all
the poor sweet cooks and housemaids.’</p>

<p>Kingston was not quite so strongly impressed as
Mrs. Mercer-Laporte had hoped by the reappearance
of the somewhat immature sister Margaret. Yet,
though he derided himself for such weakness, he could
no longer resist the absurd temptation to put things to
the test. He was quite fixed in his determination to
see Mr. Minch, if it were only to laugh at him; and
filled up the rest of the evening by cross-examining
Mrs. Mercer-Laporte on all the other pink and purple
spirits by whom she was apparently accompanied
wherever she went. Gundred, who looked on the entertainment
as a tiresome duty, calling only for one’s
second-best gown, was surprised to see her husband
so much amused and interested. When he deliberately
went across the room after dinner to sit once more by
Mrs. Mercer-Laporte, Gundred was quite startled by
such a display of enthusiasm. However, she quickly
noticed that Mrs. Mercer-Laporte had pink eyelids
and a long bony neck; her astonishment subsided into
contemptuous tolerance, and then passed into a pious
pity. She thought how nice it was of Kingston to be
so unnecessarily kind to the poor thing, perhaps the
weirdest of Aunt Minna’s weird collection of guests.
Gundred called back her attention to her own
behaviour, and set herself once more to giving an
example of nice deportment to this mob of people
who clearly had no notion what decent clothes or
manners might mean.</p>

<p>The least touch destroys a delicate balance, and<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
Mrs. Mercer-Laporte’s rather watery personality it
was that had the power, after so many years of hesitation,
to decide Kingston upon taking his long-delayed
plunge into spiritualistic circles. Little as he might
think of Mrs. Mercer-Laporte’s own rhapsodies, they
forced upon his mind the reflection that many good
and presumably prudent people derive much comfort
and sustenance from occult manifestations. With all
allowances made for credulity, hysteria, and affectation
there yet, it seemed to him suddenly, must
remain an irreducible minimum of fact about the
ghostly communications which make the consolation
of so many sad, lonely lives. The laws that govern
life and death are, when all is said and done, so dimly,
so doubtfully known and guessed, that bold must be
he who dares, on the supposition of impossibility, to
deny continued existence and continued volition to
the blessed dead. Who was to take it upon himself to
say confidently that they cannot return, for reasons
that we know not, under natural laws of which we have
no more suspicion than had the eighteenth century of
those that give us electricity? Seeing the incalculable
nature of the soul, the impalpable, mysterious substance
of its being, the probabilities that physical death only
give it freedom were, on the whole, very great and
worthy of respect. Why obstinately mock, for the
sake of a few frauds and charlatans, at a deep belief,
as old as humanity, which has been held, and is held
to this day, by many of the wisest and holiest among
men? What claim to wisdom has the stiff-necked
attitude of mere negation, based on nothing but
ignorant prejudice and the sceptic’s baseless notion of
what may or may not be possible to a thing of whose
being, and the laws that control it, he knows no more
than any enthusiastic believer in apparitions? Why
not, then, take the braver, more honest course of inquiring<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
for one’s self into the circumstances of the spirit-world?
In any case the inquiry could do no harm;
either way, one would gain certainty, instead of the
present dreary and unprofitable doubt. And if
Isabel’s purified soul were, after all, by some merciful
freak of creation, still roaming the world in her lover’s
neighbourhood, how utterly, childishly silly not to
ascertain the fact and profit by it, in place of continuing
deaf to that dear desired voice, out of puerile prejudice
and a preconceived notion that such things could not
be. Mrs. Mercer-Laporte’s enthusiasm had the effect
of forcing all these arguments on Kingston with new
and irresistible force. He could hold out no longer;
his loneliness could afford to neglect no chances of
relief; he would try what consolation the Other World
had to offer.</p>

<p>At the very notion fresh interest in life began to
animate him. Without any weak cowardice or giving
way he had yet, since the tragedy of twenty years
before, lost any personal interest in every-day life,
its bustle and ambitions. That career into which his
mother had hoped so vaguely to push him and support
him by the influence of March and Brakelond, had long
since faded from the foreground of his mind. When
at last Lady Adela gently and imperceptibly passed
away, she left her son fairly settled into the position of
his wife’s husband. Concentrated on thoughts of that
beautiful past, he never again plucked up any enthusiasm
for the present or the future. It was not
that he was afraid of them, that he had shrinkings
or morbid tenderness; they simply failed to interest
him any more. He retired into that small secret life
of his own, and the world gradually came to look on
Mr. Darnley as the pleasant but unnoticeable appendage
to Lady Gundred. Comfortably vast as was his
income, Brakelond, that insatiable old monster,<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
swallowed it all and gave no thanks. Despite his
money, therefore, Kingston soon unconsciously held
that subtly meek and subordinate place of a man
whose wife it is that owns the estate and the money.
He had no wish to assert himself, and even at Ivescar
it was Gundred who now held the reins, and concentrated
the general gaze upon herself. Now and then
she deplored to their friends her husband’s apathy
towards the Primrose League, but, on the whole, she
had everybody’s agreement when she talked of him as
‘perfectly happy in his library among his books.’
“To be perfectly happy in one’s library among one’s
books” is the blessed euphemistic privilege of the obscure
rich, and Kingston acquiesced gratefully in his friends’
attitude towards his remoteness from their life and
the empty clamours that seemed to fill it. Accustomed
long since to his own quiet, inconspicuous path, it was
with a kindling of vitality, then, that he contemplated
sallying forth into the spirit world. It was a stirring
of his old self, an emancipation from the obsession of
Gundred’s majesty. Half ashamed, half excited, half
contemptuous did Kingston set out to enter into
relations with the dead.</p>

<p>Following Mrs. Mercer-Laporte’s recommendation
he began with Mr. Muddock. But Mr. Muddock
turned out to be an illiterate and frowzy prophet, too
clearly calculated for the need of ‘poor sweet cooks
and housemaids’ to be of much assistance in the
quests of better-educated people. However, after a
brief spasm of disgust, Kingston decided to continue
his enterprise, and gradually found himself involved
in the higher spiritualistic circles. At first he had to
be content with the ordinary hireling mediums, but as
time went by, and his appetite became whetted by the
glimpses of apparent truth that he gathered here and
there amid thick and more or less palpable frauds, he<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
began to be aware that there existed, behind the common
world of second-rate believers, a sort of upper world
in touch with the Beyond. To anyone with money
the lower sphere of materialization was open, and the
meetings of Mr. Muddock and his confrères were
nightly crowded with the lonely and the bereaved,
eager for a moment’s conversation with the lost
beloved. But these interviews never satisfied Kingston,
and, as he began to discern the higher possibilities
behind, he secretly strained every nerve to enter that
set of his own people which held, or proclaimed that
it held, genuine and constant communication with
those ‘that have passed over.’ The task was not
altogether easy, and had to be cautiously ensued, for
fear of waking the suspicions and the disapproval of
Gundred. Kingston found himself despising himself
for the cowardice of such a course, until he realized
that what he was aiming at involved no sort of real
disloyalty to Gundred, and that any concealment he
might practise was in the interest of her peace and
happiness. Satisfying himself obstinately with this
rather jejune and sophistical excuse, he pursued his
way, and at last found himself admitted to the upper
section of the spiritualistic world.</p>

<p>Here at last he met men and women of his own sort,
men and women of birth and breeding and intelligence,
whom no cheap claptrap could convince, no vulgar
jugglery deceive. And yet these people, keen and
apparently sensible, believed passionately and whole-heartedly
in the manifestations they evoked. Their
lives were ruled by ghostly advice elicited at their
meetings, their desolation consoled by almost daily
conversation with their beloved dead, their doubts
turned into certainty on all points by revelations from
beyond the grave. They claimed impartiality, and
cultivated pure enthusiasm. And if the tragedy of<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
the pitiful, unholy quest had been bitterly heart-rending
among the illiterate and credulous crowds that
haunted Mr. Muddock’s circles, and sustained themselves
with ‘demonstrations’ and aitchless conversation
with the inferior dead, far more so was it among
these people of Kingston’s own world, where devotion
served as conviction, and the anguish of longing was
forced to masquerade as its own fulfilment. It was
indeed a poignant, tragic life in which Kingston now
found himself. Men and women, one and all, were
gaunt and haggard of soul with their insatiable hunger.
Some of them seemed philosophers, convinced that they
were following on the track of a clear truth; others
were manifest saints, gentle sacred souls, hopefully
worshipping a Holy Grail of their own desire’s
invention. Exalted, inspired, rarefied, filled with an
apparent serenity of devotion, their company gave
an impression of strange unearthly happiness, until the
keen edge of their underlying agony was seen piercing
through the superficial calm of their lives. The whole
air round them was poisoned by loss and the inability
to bear it. Their souls lived in a fierce, unacknowledged
groping after the lost things they had loved.
Men for vanished friends, women for lovers and
children long dead&mdash;each had some dreadful secret
craving, some inner infidelity towards the Eternal Mercy
of life. There were old polished men of their world,
strong intellects sapped, and keen eyes dulled in one
direction only, by some hoarded passion never to be
parted with, not even for the sake of happiness and
peace and wisdom. There were beautiful white-haired
women, sweet and gracious with much sorrow
in bygone years, tired with recollections, and divorced
from the heats of life, yet still held in a bitter bondage,
drugging their pain with this piteous, passionate cult
for the burden they had lost. Life and death had<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
combined to offer them calm and release from torment;
but they would have none of any such release&mdash;clung
to the ghost of their dead torment, and redoubled it by
the zest with which they told themselves that they
soothed it.</p>

<p>Into this world of insatiable emotion Kingston
threw himself heartily&mdash;hopefully, too, seeing that the
sincerity of his fellow-worshippers left no room for
doubt, and that their enthusiastic belief seemed to give
fair hope that it was justified. But soon he saw the
fearful tragedy that lay beneath their enthusiasm,
and realized how determined an illusion it was that
they cultivated. He, too, no less than they, yearned
and groped, but his nature, cooler, perhaps, than
theirs, could not accept for pure gold of revelation the
base ore of hysteria and fanaticism that they unwittingly
but obstinately imposed upon themselves for
truth. Their spirit-voices were nothing but the frustrate
echoes of their own cries, cast back to them across the
great gulf that separates the ignorant, unfaithful living
from the free, glorified dead. Sounds and sights
floated thick in their midst&mdash;honest sounds and sights,
born of no trickery, indeed, but&mdash;though none dared to
own it&mdash;engendered by the frantic zeal of the searchers
themselves. They and none other supplied the words
to which they listened in such ecstatic awe; they and
none other evoked those vanished tones, those pale
reflections of the well-beloved in which they took such
comfort. Their very sincerity, their very rapture,
only made more terrible the delusion on which they
sustained themselves, the emptiness of the phantoms
with which they tried to fill the lives that their own
distrust had left to them desolate. Only want of faith
can make death a reality. These sad, starving people,
having made reality out of the shadow, now found
themselves forced to create new shadows to exorcise<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
the old. They had allowed themselves to think that
death had power to sunder their loves, and now, after
that first self-deception, the need was fierce upon them
to invent another to nullify the first, and wipe out that
death to which only their weak terrors had given an
objective existence. From the beginning to the end
they were altogether tragic&mdash;in their sorrow, in its
cause, and in the means they took to heal it. Kingston,
as the meetings passed, found himself more and more
aloof from their consolations, more and more cold
towards the manifestations that made the comfort of
their poor struggling days.</p>

<p>It was not here, not amid these faint voices crying
what the listeners wanted to hear, not amid these dim
ghosts of bygone passion that his own still living,
throbbing passion could hope to come once more into
contact with Isabel. He pitied his fellow-seekers,
but he stood aloof from them. Sorrowing for the intensity
of their false joy, he could gain from their cult
no sustenance for his own hunger. His hunger was
not as theirs, and the beloved fallacies that supported
them could give no nourishment to him. He saw
that their quest was false, their methods a mere sop
flung to their own desire. Gradually Kingston withdrew
himself from their company. The spiritualistic
world, after all, held no solid help or conviction for him.
He passed away into everyday life again, and went
back to his quiet expectancy at Gundred’s side. Sooner
or later the wonderful thing would happen, sooner or
later the holy mystery of separation stand revealed,
but no unlawful human methods could avail to hurry
the processes of God. They of little faith might make
for themselves a world of phantoms in which to worship
a phantom; he must persevere alone, waiting patiently
for what was to come. Gladly, if he could, would he
have found satisfaction in the hollow solace invented<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
by his fellow-seekers, but as his nature, as his more
exalted perceptions, could not allow him any such
makeshift consolation, the sooner he quitted so unwholesome
and unsatisfactory a life the better. At
least, he had the comfort of feeling that he had left no
method untried, had not neglected any possible chance.
But the alley into which he had strayed had been found
blind, a short cut towards the Great Nowhere. He
must return into the broad, beaten track of life, and
go steadfastly forward, in confidence that somewhere,
some day, he should inevitably meet again his lost
companion.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>


<p>‘Dear Jim,’ said Gundred, ‘how happy he sounds!’
She folded up her son’s letter again, and put it deftly
back into its envelope. He wrote to her once a week
without fail from school, a neat, colourless letter,
breathing duty and regard. To his father the boy
wrote as the mood took him&mdash;careless, untidy epistles
about the topic of the moment. ‘Another cup of tea,
dear?’ she asked her husband, smiling at him across
the table.</p>

<p>Kingston looked at her with the approval that her
appearance never failed to challenge. A crystalline
perfection always hung about her, a clear, precise
faultlessness that was always cool and fresh and
pleasant. Age could do nothing against her. This
morning, as for a thousand mornings past, as she would
be for a thousand mornings to come, she was tranquil,
exquisite, satisfactory. If she did not actually sparkle,
she was always in a serene glow of elegance, her clear
golden hair unalterably waved and curled, her garments
refreshing in their unobtrusive charm of cut and make,<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
her hands well-kept, white, delightful, flickering here
and there from tea-caddy to cream-jug with a charming,
housewifely preoccupation.</p>

<p>Kingston, with a vivid recollection of the sibylline
untidiness that haunted spiritualistic circles, brought a
new appreciation to bear on Gundred’s unchangeably
well-bred calm of look and dress and manner. She
was very restful to be with. Pure milk, after all,
certainly was better, in the long run, than intoxicants.</p>

<p>‘Thanks, dear,’ he replied, accepting a cup of tea
into which Gundred had dutifully poured the cream
that he still hated as much as ever, but which twenty
years’ experience of her immitigable firmness had
taught him to accept without vain murmurings. ‘I
think I will run down and see Jim one of these days.
You come with me?’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ replied his wife, ‘I have such a terrible
lot to crowd into these last few days before we leave
town. The end of the Season is such a rush, and one
does dislike to leave anything undone. Besides, you
know, I think it is a pity to unsettle Jim, and I really
do rather dread the motor at this time of year. The
dust is too truly horrible. Nothing can keep it out of
one’s hair, try as one will; and then poor Morgan
has such trouble getting it out again; and one
ought always to consider the servants when one can&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘Very well, then; I will go down alone, to-day or
to-morrow. Haven’t you got some sort of show on here
this afternoon?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, dear, a Mothers’ Educational Union Meeting.
They wanted to hold it here, and one feels that one
should do what one can for others while one is alive.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t suppose I shall be missed or mourned,’
said her husband; ‘so I shall just slip quietly off, and
take the motor down to Eton. You can receive the<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
mothers, and so on, without me to help you. And I
can have a good time with Jim.’</p>

<p>‘Dear little Jim!’ said Gundred, smiling affectionately.
Her son was fifteen, and rather unusually
large for his age. But no size, no age could ever have
cured his mother of talking and thinking of him as a
little child. She had all the good woman’s utter,
tragic inability to understand that her child becomes
a boy and a man. Her Jim was still a baby. Of the
real Jim she knew nothing whatever. Their relations
were sometimes strained already, and in the future the
strain would become fiercer and more unceasing,
through Gundred’s idea of ruling the adolescent Jim
by ideas that applied to the only Jim she had ever
known&mdash;the kilted, white-frocked creature of the
nursery, who had passed out of existence at least ten
years ago.</p>

<p>‘Then that is settled,’ replied Kingston happily.
‘I’ll take Jim your love, Gundred. Anything else to
send him?’</p>

<p>The father was always giving the boy presents.
Anything that took his fancy he had a habit of buying
for Jim. Gundred, no less affectionate, considered
such indulgence spoiling and undesirable. She did
not think it quite suitable to be so lavish, and her
generosity was restricted to the orthodox seasons of
Christmas and the birthday.</p>

<p>‘My love, of course, dear,’ she replied, with a
momentary primming of her lips; ‘and tell him how
much I hope that he reads the little book I gave him
on his birthday. Say that he will find it the greatest
help. I myself have got the most wonderful comfort
from it; the prayers seem to suit one so perfectly,
and the hymns for each day are so uplifting and
helpful.’</p>

<p>Kingston, secretly unsympathetic towards Gundred’s<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
habit of collecting small devotional works and showering
them round upon her near relations, glided hastily
away from the topic. Sincerely pious and devout
herself, she made the common mistake of wishing to
impose her own precise form of devotion on everyone
else, and could not conceive it possible that any right-minded
person should not derive as great a benefit
as she did from her little pietistic volumes. To her
son, in particular, she talked religion with that terrible
intimate candour which the good woman feels to be
so natural, and the normal man feels to be so horribly
irreverent. From his mother, then, the boy shrank
and hid himself, outraged in all his most intimate
feelings of decency by the freedom with which she
discoursed to him of God and Heaven and Good, and
half a hundred secret, private matters that nothing
would have induced him to discuss even with his
dearest friend.</p>

<p>Kingston ordered the motor, glad of an opportunity
for escaping Gundred’s evangelistic activities. She
herself made a faint pretence at deploring her inability
to accompany him.</p>

<p>‘I should so like to,’ she said; ‘but the mothers
will expect me to be here, of course, to receive them.
It would be so shocking to play them false. And the
movement is such a good one. I never feel that one is
in the world solely for one’s own pleasure. One
belongs to others, and one’s highest joy should always
be to do one’s duty by one’s neighbours&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘It is rather a nuisance at times, don’t you find?’
asked Kingston, on whom his wife’s habit of uttering
edifying little speeches on all occasions never failed
to have a slightly irritating effect, even after twenty
years’ experience of them.</p>

<p>‘But one should not consider one’s self,’ answered
Gundred correctly. ‘It is a terrible thing to be selfish.<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
Besides, if God has given one special advantages, one
should be glad to make use of them to make others
happy. Houses and position and things like that are
only precious because one can turn them to the use of
others&mdash;yes? I should never like to think that I
found my factory-girls and my mothers and my curates
a nuisance. I look upon them as part of my duty in
life. And duty is the truest pleasure.’</p>

<p>Kingston felt as if he were in a dream. How
different was this atmosphere of tranquil platitude from
the feverish, restless world of longing in which he had
lately been so busy. His mind staggered at the thought
that this cool, deliberate Gundred could be of one
blood with the harried, lonely creatures who frequented
the spirit-raiser’s in desperate craving for lost loves
and silenced voices. What kin was he himself&mdash;he
with his secret cult, his deep secret ambition, to this
placid woman, so secure in the intimacy of her God, so
sedate in the conscious enjoyment of all her duties?
It was a grinning irony that held them linked; in actual
fact, they were mere acquaintances, knowing nothing
of each other, sympathizing in nothing, bound only
by the soft amicable bonds of custom and convenience.</p>

<p>Breakfast was over. Gundred gathered up her
letters in a tiny sheaf and rose. ‘I must go and see
Motherley,’ she said, ‘about the arrangements for this
afternoon. I think one ought to have iced coffee for
the poor things in this hot weather, don’t you?’</p>

<p>Gundred could never, in any possible circumstances
of rank or condition, have been induced to leave the
reins of household management in the hands of those
who were paid to hold them. She was one of the many
women who are housekeepers from their birth. The
exercise of diligent economy was very dear to her heart,
and she made a merit of indulging herself in it, by<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
insisting that she attended to such matters only from
a strong sense of duty. Kingston gave due weight to
her question as he pondered it.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he said very gravely, ‘on the whole I really
think you might allow the mothers iced coffee.’</p>

<p>‘I am so glad you think so, dear,’ responded Gundred
with an air of relief. ‘One is so glad if ever one can
give the poor things some little extra pleasure. It is
quite one of the compensations of one’s life&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘But, then&mdash;these mothers&mdash;are they paupers, or
what?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, dear me, no! They are the most excellent
creatures&mdash;quite rich and comfortable, most of them.
They generally live in Kensington or Campden Hill,
and they are all so much interested in children and
education. But, of course, they don’t often get inside
a house like this, so that one is anxious to do whatever
one can to make it a delightful memory for them. I
have got myself such a charming frock, dear, to give
them another little enjoyment to remember afterwards.
Really, you know, it soon comes quite easy to think
of others and forget one’s self. One makes a habit of
unselfishness&mdash;at least, one must try to, in one’s own
small way&mdash;and God is very good about helping them
who try to help themselves.’</p>

<p>Kingston did not take the trouble to endorse this
sentiment, and Gundred did not wait for him to do so.
She knew it was too sound to need any such endorsement&mdash;so
obvious, indeed, that she had only thrown
it out in obedience to her unvarying custom of trying
to improve her husband whenever she could.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ she went on, after a pause, ‘I must really
go about my duties now. One has so much to do. I
don’t suppose I shall see you again, dear, shall I, before
you start? I hope you will have a delightful day.
Do take care of your poor eyes. And give my love to<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
Jim, and tell him always to change his boots when he
comes in, and be sure to read his Chapter morning and
evening; he will find it such a help. And say how we
are looking forward to the holidays&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Kingston promised vaguely to give his wife’s messages.
Then Gundred passed on her way to interview
the cook, and complete arrangements for the effectual
dazzling of the mothers from Kensington and Campden
Hill. Left alone, her husband took refuge for a
moment or two in dreamland. This life of his, orderly,
decorous, colourless, with Gundred superintending its
details, and seeing that its food was good and hot&mdash;this
life of his was not a real life at all. It was a vapour,
a phantom, having no part in the true life of his soul.
His body moved on its appointed course from breakfast
through the day to bed, bandying banalities with
its tongue, looking out on Gundred’s world with amiable
eyes; but he himself, the real man, belonged to a remoter
world. In strange, far-off lands he roamed,
seeking that which for a time was lost; the gorgeous,
sombre mysteries of life and death were about his head,
shedding a glamour of ecstasy on the secret byway
that he was treading. How Gundred would stare,
what pious sillinesses would she not utter, if for a
moment&mdash;if only for the smallest fragment of a moment&mdash;her
eyes could be unsealed to see the magic tangle
of visions in which her husband was wandering, all
the while that his earthly gaze was fixed on her, his
earthly ears politely attentive to her talk, his earthly
stomach contentedly absorbing the food that she made
it her daily duty to provide. Dressed, brushed,
washed, and fed, the simulacrum of her husband
passed through the world at her side, but the thing
she walked with was a changeling; the man she loved
and looked after was the mere shell of a stranger&mdash;of
a stranger whose eyes were fixed on the immensities,<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
whose ears received her words as jargon in a
tongue unknown, whose whole life was passed in that
world of reality whose shadows now and then are cast
across this life of ours that we call real, in the glimpses
of what we call a dream. Little, visible, tangible,
clear was the life that Gundred thought the true;
vast, illimitable, without end or beginning was that
enormous infinite where the soul of Kingston ceaselessly
went seeking for the lost.</p>

<p>‘By kind permission of the Lady Gundred Darnley,
the Mothers’ Educational Union&mdash;called for short the
M.E.U.&mdash;held a most enjoyable meeting at 53, Grosvenor
Street. The hostess’s demeanour gave great
satisfaction, and her gown was held to shed real lustre
on the occasion. It was a wonderful arrangement in
blue and mauve, and no other woman of her age could
have worn it; but the delicacy of her colouring, the
serene charm of her features, were only enhanced by it,
and the mothers from Kensington and Campden Hill
spent a happy hour in devising means of copying its
most successful features. Meanwhile, an American
spinster, of world-wide renown but unappetizing appearance,
gave an interesting and exhaustive address
on the proper upbringing of children; and a Bishop’s
wife in voluminous black brocade, with a bonnet built
of bluebells, brought up the rear with an account of
how her own darlings had been triumphantly reared on
a system of perfect freedom tempered by whippings
administered officially by each other. A discussion
followed, in which old maids and childless widows
vied with the mothers in expounding the secrets of
education. The Lady Gundred Darnley herself contributed
a brief but very pleasant little allocution, in
which she insisted on the efficacy of prayer, and attributed
her own success in dealing with her dear little
son entirely to her inculcation of sound religious principles.’<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
Gundred was at the height of her glory; her
graciousness was delightful, her condescension so profound
that neither she herself nor anyone else could
guess that it was condescension at all. When the
meeting had concluded in a volley of mutual compliments,
and a unanimous vote of thanks had been
offered to their charming hostess, she shepherded
the mothers down to food with the sublimest cordiality.
The iced coffee flowed like milk and honey; tea was
nothing accounted of, any more than was silver in
King Solomon’s time. Eclairs, sandwiches, and buns
disappeared like snow in summer; of every dish
Gundred felt a calm confidence that each mother
present was eyeing it carefully with a view to imitation.
Of all life’s duties, Gundred perhaps best loved that of
setting an example to others. She felt that the Creator
had specially ordained her for that end, and was never
so completely and conscientiously happy as when
possessed with the certainty that she was duly fulfilling
His design.</p>

<p>But at last the meeting began to melt away, and
Gundred was left alone in the large deserted room.
Up and down among the little gilded chairs she roamed,
pondering with complacency the success of the entertainment.
In the course of her wanderings, she came
into view of the great mirror that filled the space
between two of the windows. She stood for a while
in front of it, contemplating the perfections that it
reflected. From the crown of her head to the glistering
point of her shoe, she, ‘the Lady Gundred Darnley,’
the fastidious critic, had not the smallest fault to find.
Her gown was an inspiration, and its fit an earthly
manifestation of the ideal.</p>

<p>‘Really,’ said Gundred to herself, ‘God has been
very good to me indeed. I declare I do not look a
day over twenty-five. No one would ever believe<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
that I am forty. That is what comes of having a
good conscience, and being a little careful what one
eats. And it is not many women of five-and-twenty
that could dare to wear a colour like this. My figure
is positively girlish, and my complexion&mdash;well, one
does not often see a better one, even among quite young
girls.’ But at this point her meditations were interrupted
by the sound of a ringing at the bell. She
concluded that it must be some belated mother, who
would be politely turned away by the butler. So she
gave no further attention to the sound, but still stood
admiring what the mirror revealed, with both hands
caressing the beautiful lines of her waist. In this
pleasant employment, however, she was startled by a
discreet cough behind her. She wheeled hastily
round.</p>

<p>A small elderly gentleman was approaching, ushered
by the butler. Gundred summoned her presence of
mind to confront this unexpected apparition. The
butler, meanwhile, was murmuring an unintelligible
name. The visitor peered inquiringly up at her. For
he was a very minute personage, smaller even than his
hostess; he had an air of patient antiquity, and his
thin neck poked forward till he had the look of a very
shrunken, very wise, very benevolent little old tortoise.
He was dressed, too, in the quaintest clothes,
that somehow suggested that they had been bought
ready-made, and were mysteriously, strangely inappropriate,
seeming as if their present wearer were
accustomed to quite different garb, and only wore
these clumsy reach-me-downs in deference to European
convention. He conveyed an impression of feeling
fettered and uncomfortable in them, of longing for
freer and more flowing vestments.</p>

<p>Gundred assumed a smile of gracious interrogation.</p>

<p>‘Mr. &mdash;&mdash;?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[270]</span></p>

<p>‘You are Mr. Darnley’s wife?’ inquired the new-comer.</p>

<p>‘I am Lady Gundred Darnley, yes. What can
I&mdash;&mdash;?’</p>

<p>‘I am your husband’s uncle,’ replied the stranger.
‘I have been in Japan for many years.’</p>

<p>Gundred instantly flashed into recognition, and
warmed into a less defensive smile. She tried vehemently
to remember all she had heard of this semi-mythical
uncle thus abruptly brought back into the
land of the living.</p>

<p>‘Ah yes,’ she answered genially, ‘you have been
there for a very long time, I know. I quite envy
you. Such a wonderful little people, the Japanese&mdash;yes?
And have you come to settle down at home
again?’</p>

<p>‘My home,’ answered the little old man, in accents
that betrayed a certain loss of familiarity with the
English language&mdash;‘my home is still out there.’ He
waved his hand vaguely, indicating the East. ‘But
I was brought over for some business. I had not
meant to come here. My kinship with your husband
has been broken by fifty years of time, and twelve
thousand miles of space. Why should I think he could
be anything but a stranger? But lately I have heard
him calling. There is something that he wants, something
that he wishes to know. I have heard him
incessantly calling. And so I came. Perhaps I can
give him an answer. Is he here, your husband?’</p>

<p>‘Something that my husband wants, something
that he has been asking for?’ repeated Gundred in a
stupor. Kingston had no wishes that were not also
hers. His whole life, she knew, was an open book
to her. And, even if it had not been, how could this
strange apparition have heard her husband’s voice?
For one wild moment Gundred imagined her husband<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
baying his ambitions to the moon, or ululating to
the universe from the middle of Grosvenor Square.
Otherwise how could his voice have penetrated to the
ears of this mysterious old man?</p>

<p>The visitor answered her unspoken thought.</p>

<p>‘A wish,’ he said, speaking slowly in his faint, sad
tones&mdash;‘a wish has a life of its own. It has wings,
and flies to all the four quarters of the air. It only
needs the opened eye to see it in its flight, the opened
ear to receive it. I have seen many strange things in
the air. I am a very old man now. And I heard your
husband’s longing, and I came to see if I could give him
any help. I am on my way. I can only be here an
hour or two. Your husband will soon be here again.
I may wait for him?’</p>

<p>All Gundred’s inquiries could elicit no more definite
information. The old man merely repeated his statement,
and asked to be allowed to await Kingston’s
return. Baffled, interested, acutely puzzled, Gundred
must needs leave the riddle of his mission unsolved,
and take refuge in the customary platitudes about the
charm of Oriental life. And thus it happened that
when Kingston returned at last, dusty and hot, from
his expedition, he found his wife sitting amid the gilded
disorder of the drawing-room, engaged in a difficult
dialogue with a stranger.</p>

<p>That this was the long-lost uncle Kingston was soon
brought to realize, and heard with unmitigated amazement
that the Abbot, or Bishop, or whatever his rank
might be, had come in answer to some imagined call.
The old man had a fantastic charm. His air of frail
antiquity, the wistfulness of his voice, the very incongruousness
of his clothes gave him a fascination not
easy to describe. He was someone out of an alien life,
a visitor from the world beyond Kingston’s ken.
A flavour of mysterious knowledge hung about his<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
wandering glances, his soft, quiet, hesitating speech,
his gentle, deprecatory manner; those misty eyes of
his had the wonder and the wisdom of eyes that have
pierced far into the hidden depths. His present surroundings,
his present garments had a sharp and
crying inappropriateness, yet, though in his air and
build there was no obvious majesty, the comparison
was all to the disadvantage of the surroundings and
the garments. Even Gundred’s luxurious and splendid
room seemed to grow tawdry and vulgar by contrast
with this unimposing little figure in its midst. The
manner of his irruption, too, into modern London life,
as well as the announcement of his equally abrupt
departure, increased the air of fantasy that hung round
him. Flashing by out of another life, flashing on into
another life, this grotesque little old tortoise was to
spare them an hour on his road through the immensities.
Kingston had no sense of kinship as he talked with this
new-found uncle&mdash;hardly, indeed, any sense of talking
with a fellow human being. The visitor was too
clearly a dweller in strange worlds, belonged, in all
his words and ways, too obviously to another sphere
of existence. As for Gundred, her faint horror at
entertaining a confessed Buddhist was tempered by
the discovery that the Buddhist was an Abbot or a
Bishop&mdash;at all events, held some conspicuous position
in the heathen hierarchy. And even a heathen Bishop
was clearly better than a heathen who was not a
Bishop of any kind. She soon, however, thought it
necessary to vindicate her superiority by attempting
to convert the pagan prelate. After one effort, brief
though bold, she was forced to desist. Mild, shrinkingly
meek, the new uncle yet showed a certain confident
command of spiritual weapons too mighty for
his niece’s resisting powers.</p>

<p>‘Why, oh, why,’ said Gundred with seraphic sweetness,<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
when the Bishop had let drop some pleasant little
sentiment&mdash;‘why are you not a Christian, dear uncle?
Surely you must love the truth&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Kingston felt hot with horror, but the visitor showed
no discomposure at this sudden outburst of proselytising
energy.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he replied, in a gentle, hesitating voice&mdash;‘yes,
I love the truth. We all love the truth when we see
it, I think. But I love a whole truth better than a half
truth. When a man is reading the Book of Life by
the light of the sun, you would not expect him to go
back and read it in a cave by even the brightest of
lamps? You have very bright lamps; I have the sun.’</p>

<p>Gundred collected all her forces for a theological
argument such as her soul loved.</p>

<p>‘But what is the point exactly of being a Buddhist,
uncle?’ she inquired, determined to fire the first shot.</p>

<p>However, the Bishop had not broken his journey
through space in order to indulge in feminine polemics.
He smiled demurely.</p>

<p>‘For one thing, niece,’ he answered slowly, ‘we are
not required or permitted by our Faith to believe that
two-thirds of the world are doomed inevitably to burn
in fire for all eternity&mdash;as you, I understand, are bound
to believe, by all your many different varieties of
Christianity. Now that, dear niece, would be, I am
sure, a very great comfort to your tender nature.’</p>

<p>Gundred was on the point of making a dignified
rejoinder, to the effect that one does not talk of such
things, or think of them, but hopes for the best. However,
she felt a hostile influence compressing her words.
A strange force was over her, compelling silence. In
another minute she found that she could hold the
field no longer. Wishing with all her heart to stay,
she yet found herself mysteriously forced to rise and
make her excuses. The uncle received her explanations<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
gently, and gave her thanks for the hospitable
reception that she had extended to a stranger. He
would not see her again, for in a few moments he must
be on his way again. But though it might be long
before they met again, he would tender her his blessing.
Accepting the tribute with graceful reserve, Gundred
passed reluctantly out of the room.</p>

<p>Kingston faced round eagerly towards the visitor.
What strange message was it that had come to him
through such unexpected lips? Was the whole story a
fairy-tale? How could his secret wishes and longings
have reached the notice of this stranger twelve
thousand miles across the sea? Surely the soul has
no system of wireless telegraphy? Kingston had a
sudden uneasy recollection of telepathy, and the vast
range of possibilities that it opened up. He fell silent,
awaiting his uncle’s next word.</p>

<p>The little old man sat huddled in his chair, gazing
straight before him. The withered claw-like hands
were fastened one over the other; the pale mysterious
eyes were fixed on things very far away.</p>

<p>‘Bound on the wheel,’ he said at last, ‘bound again
and again on the wheel of false desire.’</p>

<p>Kingston asked him what he meant.</p>

<p>‘The fire of passion,’ replied the pale tired voice,
‘is a thing old as all life. Because of some strong
passion, born many ages since, you now suffer the
pangs of loss and separation. It is no new thing, this
pain of yours. It rests with you now, my son, whether
you will carry it on with you along the road, as you
brought it with you into this stage of your journey.’</p>

<p>Astonishment, intense and paralytic, possessed the
younger man as these evidences of insight into his own
most secret feelings dropped so prosaically, so unemotionally
from the lips of this worn old wanderer.
But even astonishment yielded to the keen wonder<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
aroused by the possibility that the words revealed.
He demanded further revelations from his uncle.</p>

<p>‘Over all the fields of existence the opened eye can
wander,’ replied the other. ‘I can see whence you have
come, and in what dark places you are now wandering.
Because of the help that I hoped I could give you, I
have come here to-night. You are suffering the
penalty of bygone folly, you are chained in the bond
of a bad Karma. You have loved something, and you
think now you have lost it. Worst of all, you long to
recover it, you long to rivet round you again the fetters
of desire and sorrow. Many and many are they that
come to me, crying for the sound or the touch of some
beloved dead. Women calling across the abysses to
their dead children, their lovers, their husbands; men
clamouring for reunion with the women they have
loved. This life of yours, too, here in the West, is
filled with the cry of those who seek what they have
lost. ‘Give us back our dead,’ they say; ‘let us
touch them, hear them, speak to them again.’ In
hopes of this evil miracle your churches are crowded,
your charlatans grow rich, your Heaven finds believers.
A place to meet the dead again! Weak and foolish,
weak and foolish, not to know that love is sorrow, and
that the dead we loved stand for the heaviest grief of
our lives.’</p>

<p>‘But then,’ answered Kingston, ‘what is love?
Why do we feel it, if it is such a weak and foolish
passion?’</p>

<p>‘What is love? It is the ghost of your own dead
lives recalled to life again. What are we but the agglomeration
of innumerable previous personalities?
All our feelings are dim echoes of a hundred million
fragmentary feelings that have lived before in the
innumerable dead, who are dust of the ages. What is it
that gives us the keen joy that we take in some piece of<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
music, in some corner of landscape? It is the harmony
of countless memories that are awakened in us out of
all our dead existences by the sound we hear, or the
sight we see. Otherwise, it could mean nothing to us,
if this life were our first, if we had no previous existence
to build on. All life is memory made incarnate. All
love is a recognition.’</p>

<p>‘Then you are talking of reincarnation,’ answered
Kingston; ‘what has love to do with that?’</p>

<p>‘Reincarnation?’ said the other. ‘There is no
such thing. Reincarnation would mean that the same
You goes on into body after body, like one wine poured
on from bottle into bottle. Think for a moment what
it is that is You. What is your true personality? Is
it the thing that has fears and foolish desires and
dislikes? Or is it the secret higher thing that stands
behind the common everyday self of you? It is not
that everyday You which is indestructible. The You
of your bodily loves and hates dies with your body,
should be wiped out utterly and vanish; it is the real
You that continues through all the ages, until at last
it is made one with the Radiance from which it sprang.
Your wishes and fears must not live after you; none of
the many details that have gone to the making of you
survive, but only the total that they make up. On
the slate of life your qualities are set down and added
together. Then bodily death wipes out the items, and
only the result of the addition remains. That is
Karma&mdash;the character you build up for yourself through
the ages. And yet, if you will, you can perpetuate in
some degree the evanescent passions of your earthly
life. That is what so many long to do. Immortality,
to them, means an infinite prolongation of bodily and
emotional enjoyment. They cannot sunder their notion
of heaven from their idea of their own earthly personality.
In heaven they think they must carry their<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
earthly tastes, their earthly limbs unaltered. They
imagine that without the limbs and the earthly tastes
they will somehow cease to be themselves. They
believe that these limbs and those tastes are themselves,
and they want to enjoy them unchanged through
eternity. They do not understand that desire is sorrow,
and that to carry on the passions and the pleasures of
earthly life is also to carry on the agonies and disappointments
of earthly life. But in perfect happiness
there can be no pain. Perfect happiness has no part in
the earthly passing personality of man, for in the corporeal
pleasures of that personality pain is always
close at the side of pleasure. The Real Self suffers no
pain; only the phantom self it is that suffers; you,
and all like you, are forsaking the true for the false.
You are seeking to prolong the sorrow instead of taking
the opportunity of release.’</p>

<p>‘But what release?’</p>

<p>‘Your chance is now with you; through many ages
you had been firmly bound on the wheel of desire,
loving from life to life with a fire of anguish that grew
with feeding. For of all the phantom joys love is the
greatest and the most delusive. Love is an accumulation
of memories from bygone loves, increasing by
indulgence, from life to life, until at last the burden
of pain is too great to be borne. You, Kingston, in
this present person of yours, have suffered the incarnation
of a very ancient deadly love. How else can
you account for the mystic rapture, the violent, inexplicable
sense of recognition which makes the essence
of a tyrannous love? It is soul crying suddenly out
to a soul loved long since and lost. It is the meeting
of two selves that have grown together through a myriad
years, separated by the gulfs of bodily deaths, but
always certain to meet again, drawn irresistibly together
by the clamour of mutual desire.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[278]</span></p>

<p>‘Ah,’ replied Kingston, ‘if only one could be so
certain of that meeting again! But when, and where,
and how?’</p>

<p>‘Unhappy question! You that have been freed
are eager to enter again into bondage. If that bondage
is the keenest of all earthly pleasure, yet recognise
that it is the pleasure of the phantasmal bodily self.
It has no part with the perfect knowledge, except in
so far as it is divorced from the earthly self. And
even in this world, though of all pleasures the keenest,
it is also of all agonies the keenest. You would suffer
the pains of hell, I know, to gain the joys of that fancied
heaven. Wisdom and clear sight have not come to
you yet. You must make yourself yet another hell
of sorrow before you can hope to attain the great
emancipation. As it is, you do not even desire emancipation.
Emancipation sounds cheerless to you&mdash;lonely,
sterile, monotonous. Yet some day, at some
point on your pilgrimage, desire will so fade in you
that you will be able to understand how it is that perfect
peace knows nothing of monotony, and that the agonies
of passion do not prove that its joys are real or holy
or satisfactory.’</p>

<p>‘How do you mean&mdash;make my own hell?’</p>

<p>‘Hell is nothing more than the dominion of passion
that we establish over our lives&mdash;of passion and all
the hellish torments that passion engenders. We make
our own hells by dwelling obstinately in the world
of false desire. If we felt the only true desire, the
desire of those things that are real, then there would at
once be no more pain, and our state would be heaven.
Desire is hell. And that hell we build and stoke and
kindle for ourselves&mdash;go on kindling from life to life,
in our fancy that the fire we endure contains the
ultimate pleasure our souls can taste. It is no
capricious Personality above that sends us anguish<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
and misery. Everything we suffer follows automatically
from some action of our own in this or some bygone
phase that our marred memories can no longer recall.
Here in the West you do not understand how this can
be, though in your heart of hearts you know that it
is. But in the older, wiser East men have learned to
train their recollection until it is as easy to recall the
sorrows of a bygone life as those of yesterday or the
day before; for time is a thing that has no real existence
in the infinite life of the soul. You, because of that
old tie, knew the woman, and loved her and lost her.
Because of that fire of false desire that you had fed in
yourself for so many existences, you suffered anew
the hell of your own making&mdash;the hell of loss and loneliness.
But kill such false desires, and you kill the
false miseries of this life that men think real. You
stand at a point where you might strike upwards
towards the heaven of peace; the curse of your love
had nearly wrought out its completion, and passed
away. But by nourishing as you do the fever of longing
for the dead, you are binding yourself anew with the
chains that were beginning to weaken and drop.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t want to hear all this,’ replied Kingston
impatiently. ‘If you know so much, tell me when
and where I shall be able to find what I have lost.
Shall I find it in this life? Shall I know it when I
have found it? Remember how it passed away from
me. You seem to understand all that happened, so
tell me whether the change will affect our knowledge
of each other.’</p>

<p>‘In one tremendous moment the woman rose far
above all the false desires in which she had bred herself.
She gave her life for the truth. She sacrificed utterly
that false self of hers which was the thing that your
false self had so loved through the ages. And for her
great merit it must be that she must reap great rewards,&mdash;not<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
rewards apportioned by a personal providence,
but rewards that spring naturally out of her action.
She has shaken herself free of the links that bound her
to you. The Buddha enwombed in every mortal
Karma has torn away many of the veils that shrouded
him in that woman’s heart. Because, in her last
moment she loved the true better than the false, and
followed rather the higher love that led upwards
than the lower love which would have kept her
at your side&mdash;therefore she is released. The streams
are sundered at last on the rock of parting. That
bondage of hers has passed away&mdash;weak and erring
and desirous, perhaps, she still may be&mdash;faulty and
human, but at least that one chain of desire which
held her is snapped and broken utterly. You go
hunting for her through all the fields of your earthly
life, and she, in an instant, she was cured of all vain
longings. Therefore between you there is a gulf fixed
for ever. You, in the days of your meeting, will know
her and desire her, but she will not know you; she
will be free of you for ever, and your recognition will
wake in her no answering recognition, and thus of her
merit will be doubled your damnation.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll take the risk of that,’ cried Kingston, wanting
to smile at these august fantasies; but the low,
husky voice, the faint tremulous manner filled with
age and mystery and wisdom compelled his reverent
attention. ‘I don’t care whether she knows <em>me</em> or
not when we meet again, so long as I know <em>her</em>. The
sundered streams must meet again somehow. As
long as I feel that I have met her again, I can be perfectly
happy. That is all I ask.’</p>

<p>‘The soul lies to itself,’ answered the old man sadly.
‘Festering sorrow you will have in this, and you know
it. For all lust, whether of the body or the soul, is
sorrow. It cannot be otherwise, for sorrow and lust<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
are two words for the one great falsehood that pervades
this visible world of phantoms.’</p>

<p>‘Tell me,’ interrupted Kingston, jesting uneasily to
hide his earnestness, ‘as you have told me so much&mdash;can
you tell me in what shape I shall find her, if find
her I ever shall? Surely what she did will have
brought her greater beauty than ever, if what you say
is true, that our rewards are automatically developed
out of our actions? As for knowing her, on your theory
that all love is memory, of course I shall know her,
whether she has gone beyond knowing me herself or not.
I shall feel it in my blood when we meet again, overwhelmingly,
fiercely, as I suppose I must have known
her from the first, when she reappeared for a month
or two in my life, twenty years ago. But can you say
what form the result of her beautiful actions will take
this time? Will she be a queen or a beggar?’ Kingston
laughed, trying to lighten the impression of his
eagerness. But the old man sighed.</p>

<p>‘Sorrow, thick and thick, are you calling down upon
yourself,’ he said, ‘the bitterness of vain longing,
doubled and redoubled. How can I tell you when and
where you may meet again? Wander from magic
incantation to incantation, strengthening your disappointment
as you strengthen your longing. And&mdash;at
the end, that meeting which shall be only on one
side. Dread that reunion, dread that rediscovery of
the lost. You will not find the lost again; you will
find only the new, more beautiful thing into which her
own beautiful action has transformed that which
seemed lost. For merit plays its part in change,
inward and outward. Through what endless trials
had the holy lady Yasodhara to come before her high
spotless Karma brought her at last to the side of the
Blessed One Himself. Through all the ages she had
lived on, ever higher and holier, before she could<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
attain the end. And why should that which wore a
woman’s shape continue still a woman, in its glorification?
It was the man’s courage that showed. Can
you be certain that what she was is not now a man&mdash;a
man, perhaps, weak and earthly, but, after all, a
man, by virtue of that one instant in which all woman’s
weaknesses died in her, and only the bravery held firm.
Life is freer, bolder, wider for a man; should not the
free, bold soul pass on into a more fitting frame, where
its opportunities will be greater and its trammels
fewer? But why look forward into the great darkness
of desire? Her Karma may even yet have dreadful
sorrows to work out, yet from one sorrow, at least, it
is now free. But I had come to you to-night because,
after all my many years of life and much questioning,
it has come to me to see farther than many across the
fields of life, and sometimes to hear voices that other
ears are not opened to hear. So I heard the crying
voice of your hunger growing fierce in its loneliness,
and I saw its sorrow deepening down the road of the
future, and it seemed to me that perhaps I might give
you help in loosening the bonds that bind you to the
wheel of false desire. But now I know once more, as
all life has taught me, that it is given to none to help
his neighbour. Heaven and Hell we make for ourselves,
sometimes thinking Hell is Heaven, and Heaven
Hell, and no man can unseal our eyes or divert our
course. So you must go on your way, Kingston, and
I on mine, neither seeing what the other sees, strangers
speaking unintelligible tongues. And it will be long
before you see what I have grown to see. And yet,
in the distance of time, that day will come, and you
will be healed of all your sorrows. But now, in this
life of yours, for a test and a hell and a torment will be
the gratification of your longing when it comes. As a
trial and a condemnation of you and yours will it<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
come, suddenly, with disaster and despair, and the
possessing of it will bring an anguish bitterer than any
that has gone before, for that is the unchanging law
of Desire. So I have brought you my message and
my vain warning. The force of your craving will bring
about its own accomplishment, as, sooner or later, all
longing must bring about its accomplishment, and,
at the same time, its penalty. For a terrible moment
you will see your wish made flesh again, then all will
pass away into darkness, and your last state, through
your own action, will be worse than the first.’</p>

<p>Kingston might, in saner circumstances, have smiled
at denunciations so fantastic. But the little old man,
so quiet yet so earnest, had a strange inexplicable
dominance. He might not be believed, but he must at
any rate be respected. In all he said there was a
deep passion of earnestness, wistful and solemn, that
gave the wizened little figure in the outrageous
European clothes something of the prophet’s tragic
grandeur. Now, his mission being discharged, the
visitor arose to start once more on his way. Kingston,
in the feeling that he had no real part in this earthly
world, could make no effort to detain him. Nor would
any effort have succeeded. As he had come, abruptly,
unannounced, so he would go, abruptly, without
mitigating gradation of farewells.</p>

<p>Gently he gave his hand to Kingston.</p>

<p>‘Very far apart are we two,’ he said, with a whimsical
smile of his dried lips. ‘We speak in different
languages, across a barrier of worlds. Yet one day
we shall draw together, and our hearts be made kin
again. And now I must go. Say good-bye for me to
your wife. Out of our passions we make whips for
our own backs, and there are other passions besides
that of love for others. She too, your wife, must pay
the penalty that she has appointed for herself, and out<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
of her fancied strength shall come the great weakness
that shall impose on her, and you, and all, that punishment
which wisdom would have helped you to avoid.
None is good but he who does not know it.’</p>

<p>Kingston was not paying close attention. His
mind was fixed on the hope thus made so definite,
if perilous, of reunion with Isabel. He foresaw a
second meeting, a second recognition, even though it
might be one-sided. In the rapture of his hope he
laughed at risks, and would face all the vague punishments
foretold by the old man without a moment’s
fear or hesitation, for the chance of setting eyes again,
for however short a time, on the love that he had lost.
In that hour the fires of youth flamed high in his
heart, and he cared nothing what bitter waters might
quench them once more in the end. In a dream he
escorted the old man to the door, and watched him
pass gently away into the void from which he had so
suddenly emerged. Into the crowd of moving figures
in the street the old man passed, and melted like a
phantom. It was with almost the feeling of having
been asleep and strangely dreamed that Kingston
went back to the drawing-room, and found himself
once more in the prosaic calm world where Gundred
sat in a perpetual atmosphere of duty and terrestrial
activities. When she returned to her husband with
many questions as to the Bishop’s message, plans, and
present whereabouts, Kingston could almost have
believed that the last hour had been wiped out of his
life, or, rather, had never formed a part of it. Her
arrival made the whole episode so remote and so
fantastic to look back upon that he could scarcely
feel that it had really occurred at all. She was so
practical, so busy, so matter-of-fact; visions and
abstractions could not breathe in her neighbourhood,
grew faint, vague, unreal, until the earthly life in<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
which she moved appeared to be the only one with
which sensible people could ever have to reckon. She
had the not uncommon gift of making the invisible
seem non-existent.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>


<p>Kingston made haste to forget, as far as possible,
the ominous prophecies that had descended on him,
and in a rush of final activities the Season drew to an
end. Gundred was beginning to turn her thoughts
towards Brakelond, and as soon as the Eton and
Harrow match was over, she decreed that they must
take their flight thither. She had many duties to
discharge there in a very short time, for, after little
more than a fortnight, other duties would call them
all northward to Ivescar for the hecatombs of the
Twelfth. Meanwhile at Brakelond there was a new
school to be opened, a Church Bazaar to be patronized,
a Primrose League Fête presided over, and a horrid
Radical fishmonger to be deprived of custom, with a
stately autograph exposition of his crimes by the
Lady Gundred Darnley. There were also a few lighter
tasks, and especially a long-standing engagement to
dine with the Hoope-Arkwrights. The Hoope-Arkwrights
were new people of great wealth, who had
bought the old house of the Restormels, beautified it
regardless of expense, and ever since had been angling
for the friendship of ‘the Castle.’ By Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright’s
untiring benevolence towards bazaars,
Gundred had at last been brought to accept an invitation
to dine at Restormel. ‘Poor things,’ she said,
‘one should always give pleasure when one can, and
really it will be quite enough to ask them to tea one
day.’ Accordingly she had promised the Hoope-Arkwrights<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
the favour of her presence, and graciously
arranged her plans to fit in with the date of their
festival. At the Eton and Harrow she shone resplendent
in her favourite shades of mauve, to the devouring
wrath of other mothers, who, in spite of artificial aids,
only succeeded in looking their full forty or fifty.
She scanned the gowns and yawned over the play,
and paraded proudly about on the arm of Jim, imagining
him to be delighted with the occasion, rather than
in a cold sweat of horror at every moment, lest anyone
else should hear the comments that his mother sent
forth in her cool penetrating tones. Then, having
discharged her duty by her son and the match, she
drove back to Grosvenor Street and turned her thoughts
to departure. Kingston would run down to Brakelond
in the motor. Gundred enlarged on her longing to
accompany him, but declared that duty imperiously
called upon her to accompany the household by
train, to see that the journey was made satisfactorily,
without any loss of luggage, or extravagance, or
indecorum of conduct. Accordingly, on the appointed
day, the Lady Gundred Darnley might have been seen
amid pyramids of parcels and stacks of trunks, taking
her Hegira at the head of an army of retainers. As
for Kingston, he had yet another day or so in town,
and then must follow his wife down to the West so as not
to disappoint those ‘poor Hoope-Arkwright people’
of the glory that had been promised them.</p>

<p>The weather was settled, and he anticipated a successful
run. He was tired of London. There was
heavy over him a sense of things about to happen.
Matters seemed coming to a head. What his foreboding
meant he could not tell; he had put the old
uncle’s vague prophecies far away at the back of his
consciousness, and attributed the oppression that
crushed his spirits with a weight of impending catastrophe<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
entirely to the influences of the thunderous
weather and the air of London, stale and exhausted by
the season. It was with relief that he got into the car
on a radiant morning, and set out on his flight from
the sultry city.</p>

<p>But the day’s journey was not prosperously made.
The roads were dusty, the wind was baffling, the car
went peevishly and ill. Panting heavily along, the
machine traversed the beautiful heaths and uplands
that lie to the west of London. Kingston had meant to
break his journey far on the way. It was necessary
that he should arrive at Brakelond in good time on
the morrow, seeing that this festivity over which
Gundred so fussed was due to take place that evening.
And so, the distance down to the West being great,
Kingston had planned to spend the necessarily intervening
night at Salisbury, so as to give himself ample
time to make the rest of the journey. However,
after the long, unsatisfactory day of delays, a downright
catastrophe at last brought him to a standstill,
no farther advanced upon his pilgrimage than Basingstoke.
In that once placid but now assertive little
metropolis, hallowed at once by the memories of Mad
Margaret and of Elizabeth Bennet, Kingston found
himself forced to make his rest that night. He gave
orders for an early start on the morrow, then wandered
out from the grim desolation peculiar to English
country hotels into the streets and market-place.
Roaming from alley to alley, he contrasted old with
new, and beneath the walls of the old Assembly
Rooms, bent his mind to see the famous Ball where
Darcy first sighted his destiny. Soon, within the
old room above, barnlike now and desolate, ghostly
lights were shining, and the tinkle of long-dead
music was blending with the rhythmical tumult of
many feet. Brilliant and entrancing, Elizabeth came<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
and went, up and down the dance; Mary posed and
minced, Kitty and Lydia were agog for partners. As
the stranger outside stood and recalled that immortal
scene, the visible world around him faded quickly away,
and again he understood how much more real may be
that which has no earthly existence than that which
earthly hands may touch and earthly eyes examine.
Streets and walls of Basingstoke, hideous clock-tower
and town-hall&mdash;it was not that they were real; they
were phantoms of an ugly hour; reality, for evermore,
was that little town which never was and never will be,
where dwelt those men and women that never lived on
earth, and yet must live eternally&mdash;those men and
women so far more vivid and lasting than the ghosts
amid whom we live; those real men and women whose
voices must ring on perennially down the ages, giving
joy and satisfaction to generation after generation,
until the English language has passed with Nineveh
and Babylon into the limbo of things forgotten.</p>

<p>Sombre hucksters, clerks, shopkeepers moved up
and down the dingy roadway. To Kingston, by now,
they were but vapours; the street had changed, and
its population was of old friends, bright and clearly
recognised. Here strutted Wickham and Denny
through the dusk, red-coated and raffish, in attendance
on the giggling Lydia; and ‘stuffy Uncle Phillips,
breathing port wine,’ came lumbering paunchily
towards his doorway. Here, where a modern Emporium
had faded away, giving place to the neat-fronted
little shop of bygone days, shone the shoe-roses
that were to dance at Netherfield, and the
bonnet that Lydia bought because it was ‘not so very
ugly.’ Farther on, again, the pretentious hotel where
Kingston was to spend his night had melted into
vacancy. In its place stood the long, rambling inn,
whitened, clean and simple, with its pillared portico<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
and its hospitable entrance. And whose lumbering
chariot was it that stood there at the door, whose high
turban and commanding beak loomed out of its deep,
cavernous recesses? Surely, surely there was Lady
Catherine angrily demanding the road to Longbourne,
and insisting that the morrow’s weather must certainly
be fine? And now Mr. Bingley rode along on his black
horse, blue coat and all; Charlotte Lucas stepped
briskly by on an errand; Darcy came escorting the
effusive Caroline to the shop; last of all appeared the
centre of the vision&mdash;the world, rather, where all those
visions had been born and made real&mdash;the deceptively
meek and mild little maiden with the twinkling eyes;
the demure and inconspicuous spinster in whom dwelt
the keenest spirit that ever spoke in English, or looked
out for English ‘follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies.’
Round-cheeked, prematurely capped,
sedate, Miss Austen pattered on her road. It was with
a sudden cold shock that her passing called back
Kingston into the world of to-day. Gone again was
the real Basingstoke in a flash, and all the real people
that had dwelt there&mdash;gone like the sudden wreckage
of a dream. Now there stretched before his eyes only
the crude and banal sordor of the prosaic modern town.
Jude the Obscure, and Sue, and beastly Arabella had
violently usurped the place of Bingley and Darcy and
adorable Elizabeth. Everything was changed to ugliness
and squalor. Kingston, chilled and saddened,
returned to the hotel which once more stood on the site
of that old inn where the Misses Bennet had eaten
their nuncheon.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the time came for Kingston to
set off once more on his journey, even the bustling
streets of to-day had a cheerfulness of their own. The
sun was shining brilliantly, the motor had recovered its
good humour, everything looked solid and practical<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
and businesslike and wholesome. The vision of the
twilight had passed. Jane Austen was once more
dust of Winchester Cathedral, and the butchers and
bakers and grocers who stood by their shop-doors and
counters were now the sole occupants of the little
town; the mystic walls had melted into modern brick
and stucco, the ghosts had faded back into the world
they came from. And yet, as Kingston went on his
way, he knew that in a hundred years or less the case
would be reversed again, as he had seen it reversed
in the dusk of the previous evening. For ultimate
reality conquers ephemeral, apparent reality, and the
butchers and the bakers and the grocers would long
since have passed away, and become indistinguishable
drift again of the earth, with no memory to say that
they had ever worn flesh at all; but Bingley and Darcy
and Elizabeth would still be there, eternally young,
unforgotten and unforgettable. For what death can
touch the life invisible? Reality lives on for ever;
it is only the composite, the visible, the tangible, that
can break up in change, and pass, and disappear. The
solid is the only phantom.</p>

<p>On and on through the tranquil glory of the day and
the country the motor sped willingly upon its course, put
to its highest pressure of flight, that the whole distance
might be accomplished in as little time as might be.
To-day it ungrudgingly gave its best energies to travelling
cheerfully, indefatigably, briskly. Through sleepy
little towns it hummed and whirred; along deep lanes,
and under the shadow of great ancient forests. Then
by degrees the way became more open. The road
wound on, over stretch after stretch of purple moorland,
dotted here and there with sparse pines or hollies
that had watched the hunting of William the Norman;
over vast tracts of heather and sedge, over hill and
valley of the wide country. By now the clear freshness<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
of morning had given way to the leaden glare of
midday. The air was thick and dull with heat, and
banked clouds indistinguishably crowded the dome of
heaven, only occasionally permitting a pale sun to
pierce the haze. The sky had no longer any colour;
an indeterminate brassy heat pervaded it, and its
farthest distance melted sullenly into the livid profundities
of the landscape, till there was no horizon,
only one vague vapour filling the uttermost parts of
the world.</p>

<p>Kingston drove on unregarding. The road was
clear and uneventful; his mind, released from the
motorist’s incessant agony as to hens, inexperienced
dogs, defiant children, and deaf old women who
abruptly cross at corners, was left free to occupy itself
with the wonder suggested by his visit of the night
before to shadowland. What, after all, was this reality
that all men think of? He himself, at once solid and
evanescent, of what was he built? Of what were all
his neighbours built? Where was the permanent element
in them? Flesh and body and bones must go;
following the logical sequence, he saw that resemblances
must go, recognitions, and the consequent reintegration
of bygone personal passions. So far that mysterious
old man from the East had been right. These
superficial passions belong to the superficial Self, and
must pass away when the superficial Self resolves itself
once more into the elements of which it had originally
been composed; but behind all this, above all this,
there must needs be some immortal part, some real
Self that could recognise the eternal reality in the creations
of an old maid’s vanished brain, and understand
that the invisible has a very solid and a very vital
existence. As he thought the matter through, the
sense of physical personality began to melt away.
Gradually he grew into comprehension of the fact that<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
the He of everyday life, the He that has wants, angers,
hungers, thirst&mdash;the He, in fact, that everyone imagines
to be the enduring, everlasting entity, that all men
crave and agonize to believe immortal, has really, in the
everlasting truth of things, no genuine existence whatever.
The only He that could pass on into immortality
was the mysterious something behind, the indestructible
Thought that could call the body and all
its manifestations into being, and then, when tired,
dismiss the body again into corruption and go forward
on its road. Unable, of course, fully to dissever
his consciousness from the consciousness of physical
existence, his mind, in the absorbed immobility
of his limbs, found itself more and more nearly
able to face the fact that its personality had nothing
to do with the earthly Kingston Darnley. The earthly
Kingston Darnley, the thing that wore clothes, and
ate, and drank, and was cold if naked, and cross if
hungry, and angry if denied its wishes&mdash;that was a
mere accident, built of earthly accidents like itself,
no more capable of immortality than the food it wanted
or the clothes that made so large a part of what it
called its existence. As they, in an hour or a year,
must dissolve and pass back into their constituent
elements so must that phantasmal Self of his resolve
itself, in the course of a few seasons more, into its constituent
elements again, and die for ever with the death
of its own desires. Only the inner, secret Self must
go for ever forward upon the upward way, untouched
by all the shifting changes which that earthly, ghostly
Self might suffer. And Isabel, the lost thing for which
he was searching, what was she, and to which Self did
she belong&mdash;the real or the phantom Self? Was she
the creation of his higher or his lower desires? And
if he was to find her, as now he felt a growing certainty
that he must, what would she be? Into what form<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
would the splendour of her last moment have transferred
her? And now he began to remember more
vividly the old man’s warning. With what peril of
agony and disappointment was fraught his quest, its
realization and attainment? By the attainment of
one’s keenest desire comes that anguish of disappointment
which is fierce in proportion to the fierceness of
the desires that called it into being. Desire, by satisfying
itself, begets desire, and so, with each fresh craving
and its gratification, the chain of suffering grows heavier
and stronger, binding the soul more and more fast
prisoner in the bondage of pain. For a moment he
saw this clearly, understood that only in freedom from
the hungers of the lower self can spring that freedom
from sorrow which is the ultimate end of all human
ambition, the goal of all humanity’s highest hopes, here
and in the hereafter. Then his vision clouded, and
the lower self intruded its presence once more. His
mind dwelt on the achievement of his quest, the long-delayed
reunion with the thing that had been lost.
Even had he willed to escape, he remembered now
that in a moment of what had then been mere fantasy
he had plighted his troth to Isabel far down the future.
Now, though she might perhaps be free, he was tightly
bound&mdash;at once by his pledge as by his desires. Perhaps,
in so far as his desires had forcibly purged themselves
from grossness, the grossness of his bondage might
be softened. But a slave he needs must be to the
craving which he had so fomented by indulgence
through so many desirous years. A dim fear began to
fall like a veil across the radiance of his anticipation.
Now he understood that reunion with Isabel could not
be quite what he had thought and longed for. There
must be some change, and with that change must
come suffering. He had said, in the ardour of his desideration,
that he would take all risks of sorrow. Now<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
he first felt that the risks might well be heavy, and
the sorrow sooner or later inevitable. A sense of foreboding
filled him. What he wanted that he should
have, and with his satisfaction must come that grief
of dust and ashes which always makes the gratification
of one desire the prelude of its yet bitterer successor,
even as the drunkard’s satisfaction of his craving
only means the renewal of a redoubled, more insatiable
craving on the morrow. His desire should achieve its
end, and with that achievement find only the beginning
of another desire and a keener pain. A vague, mysterious
fear of the path which he had set himself to
tread now dominated all his thoughts. It had seemed
to lead into such bright places. But now shadows lay
thick across it, and its way stretched down towards
the abysses. He began to dread the road on which he
had so deliberately set his course ever since that violent
sorrow of twenty years before. He was suddenly afraid
of that future for which he had so long been craving,
and shrank from the fulfilment of his longer, eager
quest.</p>

<p>Without delay or misadventure, the motor covered
the distances with untiring appetite as fast as they
unfolded themselves, further and further into blue
horizon after blue horizon. Brakelond was nearing;
Kingston might soon expect to see its mysterious mass
dominating the lesser hills and woods. There was
now but one steep barrier of hills to surmount&mdash;a slow,
straight climb of three miles or more to the summit
of a ridge&mdash;and thence the road would drop straight
over easy declivities to the last brief levels that would
still separate the traveller from his destination.
Already the hill stretched ahead of Kingston. Before
him, with the appalling directness of those eternal
Roman roads, the white ribbon stretched taut and
stern, away and away to the crown of the pass.<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
Kingston set the motor to breast the long rise with all
its might, for there was no time to waste. His calculations
had run things very fine. He had only another
hour or so to get home, wash, dress, and be ready to
accompany Gundred on her mission of condescension.
If he failed, he knew well the neat reproaches that
would meet him, the mild sighings, the pathetic resignation
so much harder to bear than any objurgations.
He pushed the motor to its utmost exertions.</p>

<p>The acclivity was now climbing over open moorland.
Away to right and left fell the slopes of the hill towards
the rich levels far beneath. Evening was shedding its
glamour over the country, and all the details of the way
were transfigured by the magic of twilight. Straight
ahead, over the edge of the pass, the sun was setting in
a splendour of scarlet that spread a solid beam of fire
from pole to pole, beneath the solid purple of the cloud-banks
that rolled and towered up towards the zenith.
The air beneath was a-quiver with fire, and the earth
was kindled to a fierce and lucent tone of violet,
hot, yet solemn, mysterious, almost tragic in the
breathless stillness of the evening. Against the glare
beyond, the climbing road shone cold and ghastly
under the unbroken cloud-masses overhead, grey as
a rain-washed bone by contrast with the amethyst of
the earth and the sudden furious glory of the sky.
Leading up over darkness to that scarlet furnace in
the west, it might have been the very way to Hell.
Terrible ghosts might be mounting its straight, still
stretch. As the motor gradually rolled up its slopes,
Kingston saw that there was indeed a wayfarer upon
the road. Far away as yet, hardly discernible, a
black speck was nearing the summit of the pass. A
quick, fantastic terror suddenly seized on Kingston;
he shrank from overtaking the wanderer, from passing
him, from seeing his face. Even from afar that solitary<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>
figure had a malign influence. It was some ominous
and evil thing, that remote point of darkness on the
ghostly pallor of the road. The moments, as they
throbbed by, seemed big with terrible events about to
be born. A dreadful hush of expectation filled the
world. And still the motor climbed pitilessly, gaining
on the pedestrian so far ahead. Kingston encouraged
his foolish instincts so as the better to laugh at them.
It was this strange evening that had given him such a
start&mdash;this strange evening, filled with an immemorial,
awful loneliness. This light was mysterious and haunting&mdash;the
deep sombre purples of the moorland, the
grim, cold whiteness of the road&mdash;and then, at the end
of the gloom, that abrupt, ferocious glare beyond,
that terrifying blaze of the sunset between the two
rims of darkness above and beneath. The whole
effect was unearthly, almost crushing. And the
world seemed holding its breath; nothing stirred, no
leaf, no zephyr; the cry of no bird could be discerned,
and even the dry susurrence of the heather-bells was
stilled in the blank immobility of the atmosphere.
And through the uncanny hush the throbs and pantings
of the motor broke obtrusively, like the agonies of some
great monster in travail, intensifying by contrast
the vast loneliness of the silence. And there, arriving
at the crown of the pass, moved on the one sign of
life that occurred anywhere in the desolate prospect.
That sign of life added a strangely jarring, menacing note.</p>

<p>And then to Kingston’s cherished feelings of mystic
awe was abruptly added another. That figure far up
on the grey road was no stranger. He knew it well,
had known it from time immemorial&mdash;known it and
yet feared it. The instinct came upon him with a
crash, like the sudden recognition of something dreadful
that leaps into a nightmare. It was no qualm;
it was a certainty. He knew that when he should have<span class="pagenum">[297]</span>
reached the summit of the ridge he would look back at
the wayfarer’s face and see&mdash;<em>what</em>, he could not tell,
but something, at all events, that he had known for
years. The feeling grew on him, and grew and grew,
until at last a devouring curiosity annihilated his
previous dread. He abandoned himself to the influences
of the wizard twilight, and allowed himself to
nurse these fantasies which daylight could not have
conceived, nor his daylight self been brought to tolerate.
Now, however, by the poised, watchful dusk, their
power was strengthened and made momentarily
heavier. Overwhelming impulses of acquaintanceship
seized Kingston. Who could it be that had so enthralled
his attention even from afar? And now they
were close upon the mystery. It wore a man’s figure,
lithe and tall, in a dark knickerbocker suit. Suddenly
it turned at the noise of their coming, and looked round.
Kingston had one instant of suspense, then fell headlong
into an abyss of self-contempt. He had so
cosseted his absurdities that he had come at last to
believe in them. Why, this wanderer was simply a
respectable young gentleman of one-and-twenty or so,
whom he had never set eyes on in his life before. He
was good-looking, too&mdash;brilliantly good-looking, with
fine features, a beautifully springy form, and splendid
grey eyes, but a total stranger none the less. Kingston
felt a pang of disappointment; but though on the surface
he knew that he had never seen the boy before, yet
a dim instinct within him still obstinately insisted
that this was no first meeting. The instinct would not
be cried down by perverse facts; it clamoured for
recognition, and gradually the former acute feeling
of curiosity and acquaintance began to rise again in
Kingston. He felt sure he must already have seen the
boy somewhere, though he could not recall a single
feature. Probably he had caught a glimpse of him in<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
London, and his subconscious mind had photographed
the glimpse upon his memory. On a sudden irresistible
impulse, he slowed the motor on its course, and as he
passed the wayfarer, leaned out towards him.</p>

<p>‘We seem to be going the same way,’ he shouted
above the outraged bellowings of the machine. ‘Can’t
I give you a lift?’</p>

<p>The other looked up in surprise. Seen at such close
quarters, he was more handsome than ever.</p>

<p>‘Oh, thank you,’ he answered after a pause.
‘Thanks very much. But I am very nearly at my
destination.’</p>

<p>Refusal spoke clearly in his tones, and as he replied
Kingston felt again the same overpowering certainty
that this was an acquaintance of long standing.
Everything seemed violently, vividly familiar, yet
nothing, no inflection, no feature, could he track down
to its place in his memory. Besides, if his instinct
had been true, surely the stranger must have shared
it, and the offer of a lift would have led, as it was
intended to do, towards a mutual recognition. But the
boy evidently had no such feeling of acquaintance,
and had declined the suggestion without the faintest
hint that he had ever seen the motorist before. The
whole coil must be a web of mere fancy. Kingston
released the machine, which bounded gladly on,
leaving the wayfarer behind in the shadow of the hill.
Another instant, and they were on the summit. A
blinding glory dazzled Kingston’s eyes. The whole
atmosphere was one shimmering ripple of light. Beneath
his feet, dim in the vibrating gold, lay the last
two miles of level and plain. Indistinguishable, though
close at hand among its woods, lay the redecorated
house of the Restormels, where he was to dine that
evening. And there, beyond, infinitely remote amid
the vaporous radiance, rose Brakelond, far above the<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
world, silhouetted in shades of purple against the
devastating glare of the sunset. Wonderfully magical,
wonderfully mystical in the last fires of the evening,
seemed that fantastic vision of the Castle, fit haunt of
old dead passions and splendours, the glowing casket
of half a thousand memories, gorgeous, palpitating,
terrible. For an instant he paused on the summit of
the hill, gazing at that crown of wonder against the
flaming west; then he gave the straining motor its
head, and plunged downwards on the final stage of his
journey. Soon, as he approached it, the Castle lost
its mystery, grew solid, looming, earthly. Kingston
suddenly realized that there, high up in her great
vaulted room, its Lady Gundred was sitting in front
of her mirror, having her hair done, and wondering
whether her husband would arrive in time for dinner.
The motor rushed fiercely up the last steep stages of
the Castle hill, passed under the machicolated gateway,
and came noisily to rest in the shadow of the Erechtheion.
Kingston, thoroughly restored by now to prose
and sanity, leaped hastily out, and went to his room
to get ready.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright was a large, short woman,
genial and comfortable, always anxious to give pleasure
and make herself popular. Her husband had made a
great deal of money some years since in ways that
were characterized by his friends as energetic, and by
his enemies as shady. However, nothing very definite
had ever been said against him, so that the charitable
could avail themselves, uncontaminated, of his wealth,
and make a merit of their willingness to tolerate its
owner. In himself, he was a quiet and obscure little<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
man, who left the ordering of daily existence entirely
in the hands of his wife; and she, without vulgarity
or snobbishness, had a passion for being liked, for
being surrounded by pleased, approving people. In
the neighbourhood of Brakelond she had already
achieved general favour; she was everywhere hailed
as a ‘dear good woman’; the lavish appointments of
the house, the excellence of the cook and cellar,
accomplished only less than her own real kindliness,
and the surrounding families all ended by accepting
the new-comer with a good grace, until at last only
Brakelond held itself aloof. And now even Brakelond
was about to surrender. Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright,
however devoid of sycophantic feelings, could not but
feel that the occasion was a great one. Lady Gundred
Darnley, virtual Duchess of March and Brakelond,
was very much the sovereign of the county, no less
by position than by choice, and her first ceremonial
appearance at the Hoope-Arkwright’s board was
beyond question an event of the highest importance.
Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright had ordered her best dinner,
donned her best gown and her heartiest smile; she was
genuinely happy, and meant that the festival should
be a complete success. Gundred, at this moment
driving towards the house in a blessed glow of conscious
benevolence, could not feel the favour of her visit
more than did Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright.</p>

<p>‘Joe dear,’ said the gratified hostess to her husband,
as they stood together in the empty drawing-room
before the arrival of their guests&mdash;‘Joe dear, you will
take Lady Gundred, of course. Remember what an
interest she has in the schools and Church bazaars.
And don’t talk about the Duke, whatever you do.
She does not like it. There is nothing&mdash;well, positively
wrong with the poor Duke, but still, one says as little
about him as one can.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[301]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Hoope-Arkwright promised obedience. His
wife looked around her with complacency, surveying
all the rich perfections of the room. ‘I do think she
will find the place improved,’ she remarked.</p>

<p>The Hoope-Arkwrights’ treatment of the old house
that they had bought from the ruined Restormels
had been drastic, though reverent. They had altered
everything, and sternly pretended to have altered
nothing, after the habit of new-comers who have passed
from the first crude stage, of destruction, unto the second
crude stage, of imitation. All the old quaintnesses
and beauties had been left, but they had all been elaborated,
done up, polished, painted, exaggerated, until
they hardly knew themselves, and wore the uneasy
look of things that had been put up yesterday for effect.
The old house was now like the stage-setting of an old
house; everything wore the painful flamboyancy, the
assertive archaism of the theatre, neat, shining,
obtrusive as a new pin. The armoured figures on the
stairs and in the long oaken hall now carried electric
lamps in their mailed fists, and this combination of
practical modern contrivance with respect for antiquity
was not only typical of all the other improvements
but also a ceaseless matter of pride to the new owners
of Restormel. Their complacence and their contrivance
were equally characteristic. The same spirit
pervaded the house and made it spick and span,
bristling with expensive conveniences from attic to
cellar. The long parlour in which Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright
now stood in expectation of her guests was
a great low room panelled in oak, with leaded casements
of dim glass. At least, this is what it had been.
Now it had Art-Nouveau windows with cushioned
seats, and a broad white cornice, behind whose rim
lurked electric lights in plutocratic abundance, shedding
a pale, diffused glare, as of a ghostly day. The<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
scene they shone on was no longer ancient, but
‘antique.’</p>

<p>Everything was overdone; everything was in that
strenuous good taste which is the worst taste of all.
The oaken settles, so carved, so polished, were blatantly
unconvincing in their very eagerness to convince;
oaken tables here and there carried silver photograph-frames
and silver bowls of roses. In their
devout attempt to preserve inviolate the antiquity of
the house, the Hoope-Arkwrights had scorned the
introduction of a carpet, and the expanse of the floor
was now an artificial skating-rink of parquet, so new
and glossy that it might have served as a mirror, over
whose surface were scattered a few desolate islets of
rug that slid treacherously away beneath unwary feet,
carrying their victim in a helpless slide across the room.
Under the tables sat monstrous great green china cats,
painted all over with little roses in patterns and
ribbons. Their emerald eyes of glass glared grimly
forth from each lair, and their presence added a neat
note of modern art to the pristine simplicity of the
other decorations.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright gazed approvingly
around, the door opened, and two young men came in.
One was short and pleasant and plump&mdash;clearly the
son of the house; the other was slender, tall, and dark,
of remarkable beauty, both of feature and build. His
hostess welcomed him warmly.</p>

<p>‘I do hope you are not tired after that long walk,
Mr. Restormel,’ she said; ‘I am sure you will be glad
of your dinner. The air does give one an appetite,
doesn’t it? I have only walked as far as the garden
to-day, but I declare I feel as famished as a wolf.’</p>

<p>The kind lady screwed up her comfortable features
into fanciful imitation of a famished wolf. The young
man smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[303]</span></p>

<p>‘No,’ he said, ‘I don’t often get tired with walking.
And then think what I had to look forward to at the
end of it.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright looked conscious for a
moment.</p>

<p>‘Ah yes,’ she replied with some feeling. ‘I am
afraid we are dreadfully thoughtless, Mr. Restormel.
It must be dreadful for you to come back here and
find a lot of new people kicking about in your own
house, as it were; I do hope you’ll try not to think
about it. When Jack told me how he had met you
at Oxford, and who you were, and all about you, I
declare I felt quite shy and uncomfortable at the
thought of asking you to pay us a visit. And to arrive
just to-night, too, when we have got a sort of little
dinner-party too. I am sure you must find it very
trying.’</p>

<p>The handsome boy smiled down at her again. She
was evidently in anxiety that he should be happy
and set at his ease, though her methods lacked subtlety.
He accepted her sympathy, but diverted her conversation.</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ he replied, ‘we come and go, all of us, and it
never does to bother about what one cannot help.
Anyhow, I am sure Restormel never had jollier, kinder
people in it than it has now. Tell me, Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright,
who is coming to dinner to-night?’</p>

<p>‘What, has not Jack told you?’ cried the hostess,
with a little inflection of pride, turning to her son.
‘Well, there are Sir Nigel Pope and his new second wife,
and the Martin Massingers with two sisters, and the
Archdeacon and Mrs. Widge, who are staying with
them, and the Lemmingtons, and the Goddards, and
the Pooles&mdash;yes, and the Darnleys&mdash;from Brakelond,
you know, Lady Gundred and her husband.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Lady Gundred. Of course I have heard all<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
about them. My mother used to see a good deal of
her at one time, before the place was sold.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, how stupid I am! I am always forgetting
that you know all the people about far better than we
do, though only by hearsay, most of them. Yes, of
course you know about dear Lady Gundred. You
will be next her at dinner, on the other side from my
husband. What a comfort! You will be able to talk
to her about old times. I am afraid you will be in
starvation corner, by the way, Mr. Restormel, but I
thought&mdash;even before I remembered that you knew
her&mdash;that you would not mind that if you were next
to dear Lady Gundred.’</p>

<p>‘You must remember,’ answered young Restormel,
‘that the place was sold when I was only six months old,
so I cannot feel that I have any very intimate acquaintance
with Lady Gundred. Tell me some more
about her; what is she like?’</p>

<p>‘The sweetest and best of women, Mr. Restormel.
And so pretty. Quite extraordinary, for she must
be&mdash;what?&mdash;well over thirty, certainly, and yet she
looks quite like a young girl still. Fair, you know,
with a delightful complexion and lovely golden hair,
and that kind of beautiful little figure which never
alters. Yes, she must certainly be over thirty. She
has got a son who can’t be less than fifteen. Jack,
surely Jim Darnley is quite fifteen?’</p>

<p>Young Hoope-Arkwright glanced up from the photograph-book
with which he was beguiling the time.</p>

<p>‘What, Jim Darnley? Oh yes, fifteen, at least.’</p>

<p>‘There you are. And his mother looks like his
sister still. He is the dearest boy, Jim Darnley&mdash;the
simplest, most unaffected creature. And, of course,
he will be Duke of March and Brakelond one of these
days, when his grandfather dies. They are sure to
revive the title for him. But he might be just anybody,<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
and his mother the same. I have always wondered
why she does not make her husband take her
own name. But no; she is such a really good woman
that she thinks a wife ought always to stick to her
husband’s name. That shows you what she is. And
such a worker of all good kind works, indefatigable
among the poor and the sick&mdash;for ever sending out
soup and boots and blankets, you know. Her life is
quite made up of kindnesses. They very, very seldom
dine out, the Darnleys, in the country, so that you are
lucky to meet them here like this to-night. Her
husband is a very nice man too. I am sure you will
like them both immensely. But of course she is the
most interesting of the two.’</p>

<p>At this point the other guests began to arrive, and
Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright was forced to abandon her
dialogue with young Restormel. She introduced him
rather perfunctorily to one or two of the new arrivals,
taking pains to slur over his name until she should have
the opportunity of explaining his identity quietly to
them at dinner or afterwards; then she turned to her
hospitable duties, and Jack Hoope-Arkwright carried
off his friend into one of the windows, where they stood
laughing and talking together while the guests gradually
gathered. Then, after a few moments, Ivor
Restormel and his host came back towards the hearth
to look at some photograph or ornament that stood on
the primitive oak table that stood close by, and thus
it was that they were once more close at the hostess’s
side when at last, in a significant pause, the butler
re-entered. His appearance suggested an archbishop
of sporting tendencies, and he evidently cultivated a
nice sense of drama. His voice boomed sonorous as
he announced:</p>

<p>‘Mr. and Lady Gundred Darnley.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright moved forward a step or two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[306]</span></p>

<p>Minute but majestic, the Lady Gundred Darnley
proceeded up the room, panoplied in perfections,
and giving exactly the proper amount of smiles, of
exactly the proper kind, in exactly the proper way,
to all the proper people. At her heels came Kingston,
but nobody cared to look twice at him. Lady Gundred
was the star of the evening; as she entered, she had
the double consciousness of not only conferring great
pleasure, but of conferring it in the handsomest and
most ungrudging manner. For in the plenitude of
her generosity she had decided that it was her duty
not to fob off poor, kind Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright’s
dinner with one of her second-best frocks; and now
she reaped the reward of her efforts in the general gaze
of delight that greeted her appearance in one of her
smartest gowns, looking incredibly crisp and young
in a beautifully-built harmony of pale blue and pale
gold. The frock set the crown upon the favour of her
coming. It was, indeed, very rarely that the Darnleys
dined out in the neighbourhood of Brakelond, and
therefore Gundred was the more ready to emphasize
the approval that her coming was to bestow on Mrs.
Hoope-Arkwright in the eyes of all the county. Dear
woman, how good she had been about that bazaar!
how loyally she had turned away her Liberal gardeners!
She well deserved not only to be dined with, but to
be dined with in one of one’s decent gowns. And
then one might ask her to tea at Brakelond, and show
her the pictures. Gundred showed herself sweet and
kind in the highest degree, as Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright
made her welcome. Her manner always had a tranquil
friendliness and a grace so instinct with placidity
that only the most discerning could have discerned
her underlying pride, in her demeanour’s very negation
of pride. Here and there, perhaps, an acute onlooker
might guess that her gentleness was founded on an<span class="pagenum">[307]</span>
intense arrogance unsuspected even by its possessor,
on a self-esteem so tremendous as to have passed
beyond all hint of self-assertion into a Nirvana
of apparent unself-consciousness. An ingenious friend
in London, indeed, had once said that, though Gundred’s
manner and signature unfailingly wore the
proper style of ‘Gundred Darnley,’ yet that, reading
between the lines, both of manner and signature, one
could always see that it really ran, ‘Gundred March
and Brakelond.’ However, her pride was far too cardinal
a point of doctrine to be made the theme of declamation;
Gundred never obtruded it, never lowered its
dignity by insisting on it, never allowed it to make
her offensive, except in minute and subtle ways.
Now, as she pressed Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright’s hand
and commended her kindness, the hostess felt that
never had she met anyone so pleasant and cordial and
delightfully unaffected.</p>

<p>Then Gundred raised her eyes and looked round
her to see who else might be in the room. She
saw Sir Nigel, saw the Lemmingtons, saw the
Archdeacon and his wife; she was glad that Mrs.
Hoope-Arkwright had chosen such unexceptionable
people to be witnesses of Brakelond’s condescension.
Then her gaze moved on. The next moment she saw
somebody whom instantly, inexplicably, she disliked
as she had never before disliked anyone at first sight.
Cool and gracious, Gundred was the last person in the
world to feel unusual emotions; but now, as she looked
at a tall dark young man&mdash;a boy of about twenty,
he seemed, remarkably beautiful and attractive&mdash;her
soul started proudly away in a flurry of instinctive
repulsion. He was unpleasant, that good-looking
youth, altogether unpleasant and odious. She had no
notion why this feeling swept so completely across her
mood; it took entire possession of her. Quickly she<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
averted her eyes, and glanced round the uneventful
circle of the other guests. They, for their part, quite
unsuspicious of Lady Gundred’s sudden outburst of
dislike, were concentrating their admiration on the
calm grace of her manner, so exquisitely civilized and
concise. Passions must always be very far from that
serene pleasantness of demeanour. And meanwhile
Gundred was busy thinking how displeasing that
young man was, while with soft smiles she responded
to Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright’s compliments. But suddenly
the hostess became conscious of someone at her
side. She turned towards the handsome dark boy, and
before Gundred could see what was to happen, had
brought him forward. ‘Let me introduce you to Lady
Gundred Darnley,’ she said. The young man made a
motion as if to put out his hand. Gundred instantly
responded by taking that cruel revenge which is always
in a woman’s power on such occasions. She ignored
the hand, gave a glacial little smile and a glacial little
bow. The young man seemed slightly astonished at
this chill, and his eyes met hers for a moment. They
were splendid eyes, those of his&mdash;cool, deep, grey,
kindly. They glanced with wonder into the ice of
Gundred’s stare, and in that moment she felt his gaze
intolerable, saw things that she mysteriously hated
and dreaded in those grey depths. For once in her
life Gundred’s composure was faintly ruffled. She
dropped her glance, and faintly blushed with annoyance.
This is what one got by being generous and
dining with presumptuous people like the Hoope-Arkwrights.
Under her calm, imperturbably smiling
exterior Gundred was gravely annoyed. She moved
backwards, away from this unwelcome introduction.
Her movement produced a change in the arrangement
of the crowd. Kingston stepped forward, and came
into sight of the tall, slender figure with which his wife<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>
had seemed to be talking. Already he had had a strong
conviction that he knew the back; now that he saw
the face, he recognised the wayfarer whom he had
passed on his road that afternoon. And once again,
tyrannous, overwhelming, came the certainty of old
acquaintance. Before, however, he could start a conversation,
dinner was announced, and Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright
began to marshal her guests in procession.
Gundred hailed the release with joy, and passed out
with gentle majesty at the head of the cortège.</p>

<p>What, then, was her indignation when, having
settled herself at her host’s right, delicately removed
her gloves, unfolded her napkin, untied the little bundle
of pastry faggots that lay before her knotted up with
blue ribbon, she turned towards her other neighbour,
and discovered that he was no other than the strange,
beautiful young man for whom she had conceived so
unusually sudden a dislike. She hated strong emotions,
and very rarely indulged them, but this one was
beyond her control&mdash;a matter of instinct. In the
first flash of revelation, she felt convinced that this
beautiful boy was a corrupter of youth, a contemner
of religion, everything that was bad and horrible; she
plumed herself immediately on the nice discernment
that enabled a Christian woman to divine such things,
and made a virtue of the hostility she harboured. Talk
to such a creature she would not. She turned quickly
upon her host, and initiated the usual introductory
conversation on the beauty of the table decorations.</p>

<p>The dinner-table was of a piece with the rest of the
restored house. It was so aggressively old as to be
obviously new. It was of that ancient oak which is
for ever modern; and, in deference to primitive
simplicity, it wore no cloth. Glass and silver gleamed
down its long narrow stretch, and in the middle
ranged a hedge of roses and orchids embowered in<span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
ferns. Electric light was not permitted to mar its
harmony with any suggestion of modernity. Candles
in plain old silver candlesticks illuminated the table and
its guests, shedding a soft and discreet glamour of pink
from beneath their shades of crimson paper. Gundred
commented amiably on the beautiful effect attained.</p>

<p>Mr. Hoope-Arkwright, who left such details to his
wife and the decorators, made what reply he could,
and the conversation flowed placidly along the lines
that Gundred loved, developing in the way that
showed her social aptitudes at their best.</p>

<p>‘My wife says that electric light does not do for a
dinner-table,’ explained Mr. Hoope-Arkwright. ‘Too
harsh a light it sheds, she tells me. I don’t understand
such things myself, but everyone says the candles and
their pink shades are very becoming.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed,’ replied Gundred; ‘one always likes
a soft gentle light. And so clever of dear Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright
not to have a tablecloth. All the glass and
silver shows up so well. Such wonderful taste she has.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I always like a tablecloth myself, you know&mdash;seems
cleaner, somehow; but Maggie says it is not the
thing in a house like this.’</p>

<p>‘Such a delightful house&mdash;yes? And I do think
you and dear Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright have been so
tactful about it&mdash;altering nothing, as it were, and yet
improving everything, and making it so comfortable.
It was very different in the poor Restormels’ time. I
can remember what it was like then.’</p>

<p>Mr. Hoope-Arkwright saw that she had not grasped
her other neighbour’s identity, and as personal explanations
are not easy unless one has the tact to shout
them, so that their object may have no suspicion who
is meant, he preferred to turn the conversation into
other channels. ‘Are you fond of flowers, Lady
Gundred?’ he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[311]</span></p>

<p>In such temperate dialogues Gundred particularly
shone. She was especially valuable in London for her
power of flowing endlessly and amiably on about
matters which could never possibly interest or stimulate
anybody, or arouse difficulties of any sort. She
was felt to be a thoroughly safe guest. So Mr. Hoope-Arkwright’s
question gave her a most favourable
opportunity for the display of her favourite qualities,
and she seized upon the topic with joy.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes,’ she answered; ‘I have always been devoted
to flowers. Such a comfort they are&mdash;yes?
Quiet friends, I always say. One could not live
without them.’</p>

<p>‘Roses, now&mdash;do you care particularly for roses?’
pursued Mr. Hoope-Arkwright.</p>

<p>‘Oh, the queen of flowers,’ she made haste to reply.
‘But, do you know, I can never quite care for a rose
that has no scent. There is something unnatural
about it&mdash;no? But these of yours are perfectly
lovely, and how sweet! Do you find the soil good for
them here?’</p>

<p>‘Well, as to that I can hardly tell you. I leave such
matters to my wife and the gardener. But they are
fine fellows, as you say.’</p>

<p>‘Quite like little pink cabbages&mdash;yes? Only so very,
very beautiful, of course. How one loves a rose!
And they go so well with the orchids too. So nice
to be able to grow orchids.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, they do run into money, orchids do. You
would be astonished at the prices some of them fetch.’</p>

<p>Gundred thought this a vulgar ostentation, and
assumed her mildly pious air. ‘And I dare say, after
all, not half so beautiful as many a dear little flower of
the hedgerows?’ she replied. ‘Money means so little&mdash;yes?
I often feel that one’s greatest pleasures are
those which cost us least. The lovely lights on the<span class="pagenum">[312]</span>
hills, the roseate hues of early dawn&mdash;these are the
joys which no money can buy. How thankful one
ought to be to Heaven for giving us all these healthy
pleasures&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Hoope-Arkwright nor Gundred herself
had any exhaustive experience of early dawn and its
roseate hues. But the sentiment was improving and
laudable. The host, however, was inclined to be
prosaic.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ he answered, ‘one need not sniff at money,
either, Lady Gundred. Where would one be without
it?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, where indeed?’ sighed Gundred; ‘and yet
one never has enough. But one always likes to feel
that there is something higher than money, Mr. Hoope-Arkwright&mdash;yes?
Money can give you all these
beautiful flowers, and this delightful house, but can
money give happiness, Mr. Hoope-Arkwright?’</p>

<p>‘Anyway, money can give us most of the things that
make up happiness.’</p>

<p>‘Not a tender, loving heart, Mr. Hoope-Arkwright.
Not a childlike faith and simplicity,’ replied Gundred
pathetically. ‘And without these what is life? Our
only real happiness lies in doing what one can for
others. And that, I always feel, is the most real and
precious use of money&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Mr. Hoope-Arkwright’s most characteristic activities
had hitherto lain rather in doing others than in doing
things for them. Also, he had very different views on
the use of money from those so correctly enunciated by
Gundred. So he preserved a discreet silence on the
point, and listened unprotesting while she proceeded
to enlarge on the more idyllically beautiful possibilities
of life. He inserted ‘Ah yes,’ and ‘Ah no,’ at intervals
into the interstices of her remarks, and cast
about for an early opportunity of taking refuge with<span class="pagenum">[313]</span>
his other neighbour. Mr. Hoope-Arkwright did not
really share his wife’s hospitable instincts, and he did
not care two straws about Lady Gundred Darnley&mdash;or,
for that matter, about Lady Anybody Anything.
‘To do the civil’ he saw to be his duty, but the
moment that dinner was half over and his duty duly
discharged, he meant to indemnify himself for his
endurance of this dull, pretty woman and her boring
platitudes by having a good time with his other partner,
Sir Nigel Pope’s second wife, a young woman of a
gay and kindred spirit. Accordingly, when the roast
peacock had arrived, he seized his moment with great
promptitude.</p>

<p>‘Now, that is what I call quite poetic,’ he exclaimed,
when Gundred had finished by saying that she thought
a good, useful life was like some fragrant flower.
‘What do you think, Lady Pope?’</p>

<p>Lady Pope made a prompt, flashing reply, and in
another moment was engaged in a warm duologue
with her host; Gundred was left out in the cold. She
felt a certain annoyance at being dropped like this.
Her self-complacence would not, of course, let her
know that she had been dropped. She knew that she
had been giving poor dear Mr. Hoope-Arkwright one
of the pleasantest half-hours of his life&mdash;a little uplifting
talk with a really refined woman&mdash;but still it
was just a trifle tiresome that he should have so very
keen a sense of duty. Evidently it was only the
strictest sense of duty that had made him change
partners so precisely at the halfway house of the meal;
but Gundred would have been better pleased if he had
not allowed his sense of duty to be quite so minute
and intrusive. Very proper and right, of course, yet
almost too scrupulously right and proper to be altogether
tactful. Then it suddenly occurred to her that
she in turn ought to talk to her horror on the other<span class="pagenum">[314]</span>
side. No, that she would not. Duty and right themselves
should not compel her. She stared stonily
before her, eating the peacock with wrathful and
mincing precision. She would hear no preliminaries
on her right. She gazed straight out across the table.
Far off she saw her husband looking at her. Watchful
interest and curiosity filled his expression as he glanced
from her neighbour to herself. Perhaps he was wondering
why she was not talking to him. Duty clearly
commanded her to. But for once in her life correct,
decorous Gundred would be deaf to the call which she
usually heard and obeyed so sedulously. She nibbled
at a pastry faggot, and kept a stern silence. Her
neighbour made two attempts at conversation, but
she answered so coldly as to nip them both in the bud.
Then, abruptly, her attention was caught and riveted.
The pink candle-shade in front of her was tilting to one
side, threatening every moment to take fire. She
looked anxiously round to her host for help, but he
was by now far too deeply engaged with Lady Pope.
Gundred gazed in annoyance at the paper shade.
Surely it was beginning to smoulder? Ever since
the catastrophe at Brakelond Gundred had disliked
fire hardly less than the burned child, and now her untutored
desires would have prompted her to get up
and move away. But she had the martyr-like courage
of her breeding and conventions. She sat there in
suspense, smiling, calm, and altogether smooth to
look at. However, there was no need, after all, to
feel so helpless. She must inevitably appeal to the
young man on her right. Speech had become a
necessity, though always a distasteful one. Besides,
after all, how absurd to let even so strong an instinct
make one uncivil! Gundred fought down her reluctance
bravely, and turned to her neighbour.</p>

<p>‘Do you think,’ she asked firmly, though in a low,<span class="pagenum">[315]</span>
rather strained voice, ‘that you could lower that
shade a little? Do you see, I believe it will catch fire
in a moment&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>No answer followed her appeal. In astonishment
she repeated it, and raised her eyes to her enemy’s
face. She was astounded by what she saw there.
She herself had been put out, even alarmed for a
minute by the imminent fate of the candle-shade;
but her neighbour’s gaze was fixed on the point of peril
in a set white pallor of pure terror. Never in her life
had she seen such an agony of dread on any human
countenance. The young man, so beautiful, so lithe,
so strong, was a monstrous coward. His face was
rigid with fear, his eyes staring horribly. The sight
was indecent in its nude revelation of weakness. In
an instant all Gundred’s courage came back to her,
and at the same moment her hatred for her neighbour
was mitigated by a cold ferocity of contempt. He
was still evil and hateful, but now he was contemptible
also. He, a man, to be so terrified of a little burning
candle-shade! At that same moment the shade tilted
further, caught, and flamed. Gundred was conscious
that her neighbour’s hands clenched upon his chair in
a convulsive jerk of fright. Calmly, firmly she
reached forth her arm, and crushed the blazing paper
into a blackened flake. Servants came running to
sweep up the ashes, and Mr. Hoope-Arkwright confounded
himself in apologies for his neglect. Gundred
showed herself perfectly amiable to her host, but on
her other neighbour she would have no mercy.</p>

<p>‘I saw it was going to catch,’ she said gently, ‘and
I asked Mr.&mdash;this gentleman, to put it out. But he
cannot have heard me, I think.’ She included both
men in her remarks, and spoke in soft, far-reaching
tones that could not escape their attention. Mr.
Hoope-Arkwright made some polite rejoinder, gave<span class="pagenum">[316]</span>
her a few compliments, then went back to his dialogue
with Lady Pope. Gundred, reinstated in her own
self-esteem, turned to see what effect her cut had had
upon the coward. Had he winced beneath the lash?
Yes, evidently he had. Gundred was justly pleased.
Heaven had made her the instrument of his well-merited
punishment. And now he was trying to make excuses.
She would listen, so as the better to slight them. She
offered a coldly acquiescent air as he began to speak.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry,’ he said in a slow, hesitating voice,
hardly yet restored to equanimity. ‘I am afraid I
heard you perfectly.’</p>

<p>Gundred would see no courage in the confession.
It was mere effrontery. ‘Yes?’ she replied. There
was a pause. ‘Yes?’ repeated Gundred cruelly, demanding
an answer.</p>

<p>The young man went on, speaking with difficulty.
Gundred felt a keen joy in thus dragging the coward
through a confession of his cowardice. To be a man
and a coward&mdash;that was not punishment enough. He
should also know what a woman thought of him.</p>

<p>‘I ... well, the long and the short of it is, I can’t
face fire,’ continued the hesitating, painful voice.</p>

<p>‘You would not make a good soldier&mdash;no?’ rejoined
Gundred, with a pinched little smile.</p>

<p>‘Oh, in that way I hope I should be all right. It is
flame and smoke and burning that I cannot face. All
my life I have had the fear. I suppose everyone has a
secret horror in their lives. Fire is mine. I have
suffered from it always. You don’t know what it is.
It is something far worse than fear. I am not really
afraid of the fire. I knew how ridiculously harmless
that little burning shade would be, but it was the fire,
the flame that made me&mdash;well, made me almost sick
with a shrinking&mdash;a sort of supernatural repulsion that
I cannot explain.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[317]</span></p>

<p>‘How very unfortunate!’ answered Gundred, deliberately
cool and incredulous in tone. ‘It must be
so very inconvenient&mdash;yes? People are sadly apt to
misunderstand, don’t you find?’</p>

<p>The young man, however, was a worm only in his
tendency to turn. He flushed, seeing clearly the hard
malice of her mood. ‘Very few, thank Heaven,’ he
answered, ‘have ever had the opportunity of misunderstanding.
You have been especially unlucky,
and so have I.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t mention it,’ replied Gundred, politely
demurring.</p>

<p>‘I must, obviously,’ he went on. ‘You see, one bears
one’s secret horror, whatever it may be, quite alone,
telling nobody about it. But sometimes, once or
twice in one’s life, some cursed accident drags it to the
surface, and the horror becomes too bad to bear, and
an outsider gets a glimpse of it. I have been unfortunate
in the moment of my accident, and in the person
who saw it, and there is no more to be said: that is
all.’</p>

<p>The young man, the coward, the unmentionable,
seemed actually to be snubbing the brave, the serene,
the faultless Lady Gundred Darnley. This must instantly
be put a stop to.</p>

<p>‘One does not like to believe that any man can have
a fear too bad to bear&mdash;no?’ inquired Gundred, very
gently and softly, as if asking for the sake of information.</p>

<p>The victim had clearly had enough of this persecution.
‘After all,’ he said, ‘when one comes to think
of it, I suppose you are yourself more or less responsible
for my fears, if anyone is.’</p>

<p>Gundred gave him a blank blue stare.</p>

<p>‘I?’ she questioned in amazement, as if the very
suggestion were an insolent piece of irreverence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[318]</span></p>

<p>The young man was not abashed, however, and proceeded
to make his position good.</p>

<p>‘You had a ghastly fire at Brakelond many years
ago,’ he answered. ‘Somebody was burnt&mdash;a cousin
of yours, I think. Well, that fire was a great shock to
my mother, and upset her dreadfully. I was the result,
and I am the incarnation of her terrors.’</p>

<p>Gundred hesitated in her enmity, and her manner
changed.</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon,’ she said; ‘but I did not quite
catch your name before dinner. But from what you
have just said, are you&mdash;surely you must be&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I am Ivor Restormel,’ said the enemy. ‘I was born
about twelve hours after your fire at Brakelond. So
you cannot wonder that I carry the traces of it in my
life, as it were. And so, you see, I was right: you
are in some way responsible for my dread of fire.
Wasn’t it a careless servant who set light to the old
wooden wing of Brakelond? Well, if it had not been
for that careless servant, I should not have had any
dread or shrinking from fire.’</p>

<p>‘Really,’ said Gundred, hardly heeding him, ‘this
is wonderfully interesting. Then you are poor dear
Mary Restormel’s son? I used to know your mother
so well in the days before you were born. And then
the place was sold, of course, to these Hoope-Arkwrights,
and I never saw much of poor dear Mary again.
But how very strange to meet you here&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Gundred was always faithful to her traditions and
her memories. The stranger came immediately into
the hallowed circle of Gundred’s own class, and no
longer suffered the condemnation of the outsider. In
her heart of hearts, Gundred, perhaps, would never
surmount her first mysterious sense of repulsion; but
anger, disdain, reproof must at once be very much
modified in the case of a person who now stood revealed<span class="pagenum">[319]</span>
as no longer an unhallowed, nameless member of the
Hoope-Arkwright world, but as poor dear Mary Restormel’s
son, with the right divine to Gundred’s sympathetic
loyalty. Her strong and dutiful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de
corps</i> even prompted her to something resembling an
apology.</p>

<p>‘Of course I had no notion who you were,’ she said.
‘What you tell me is a perfect explanation. How
very dreadful for you, though! But I quite understand
your feeling&mdash;a simple instinct. Yet, of course,
until one knew who you were, it did seem a little strange&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Ivor Restormel had ceased to take much interest in
the question.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well,’ he said, ‘one is always meeting odd things
in life. I only wish I had escaped that particular
oddity. However, I do all I can to get the better of
it, and in a way I have succeeded. I can face flame
more than I could, though it still gives me the same
supernatural creepy feeling. What I have suffered,
too, in seeing women smoke is more than I can express.’</p>

<p>‘Not at all a nice habit, I think,’ replied Gundred.
‘Somehow, it never seems appropriate or ladylike&mdash;no?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it is not <em>that</em> I mind, but the possibilities are
so horrible. A man wears rough tweeds and things.
No spark could settle on them. But think of the innumerable
frills and fluffs and films that a woman has
floating all round her nowadays. A chance spark,
and the dropping of a red cigarette-end, and&mdash;ah!
it doesn’t bear thinking of.’</p>

<p>He broke off, shuddering, and Gundred could see
that at the bare notion of such a catastrophe the old
white, shivering terror had laid hold of him. She
had heard before of these strange, inherited passions,
prenatal, ineradicable, but this was the first instance<span class="pagenum">[320]</span>
she had ever met with, and it filled her with interest
now that she realized that its victim was a man of her
own order, and as such, of course, not to be classed
in the common rank of cowards. Her subconscious
fear and dislike of Ivor Restormel still held their place
in her mind, but they had retired to the background of
her thought for the moment, leaving room for the curiosity
that his identity and his idiosyncrasy aroused.</p>

<p>‘So very dreadful,’ she murmured, ‘for your poor
mother. I had not realized that dear Mary had been
so much upset by that awful fire. You know, Mr.
Restormel, I feel as if we were quite old friends, you
and I. As you say, I cannot help feeling, after all,
that we have got some of the responsibility to bear for
the odd feelings that you have inherited. You have
had quite a distressing legacy from those old wooden
rooms at Brakelond&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Laudably, deliberately friendly, Gundred raised her
neat smile to meet Ivor Restormel’s gaze. He was
looking at her full, with his deep grey eyes, true and
honest, and altogether pleasant. Yet, as she met their
glance, suddenly the instinctive hostility surged up
into Gundred’s mind with redoubled strength. Fear
and dislike seized her. She could not bear that glance,
could not tolerate her neighbour’s presence. She
turned away her head with a sensation of almost
terrified hostility. What was this imperious repulsion
that now held her&mdash;the first emotion that had ever
threatened to pass the limits of her self-control?
She could not understand it; never before had she felt
anything even remotely resembling this blind, paradoxical
dislike. Perhaps, years since, her bitter
memories of Isabel had been tinged with the same
unreasoning horror, but those far-off qualms had been
faint and colourless compared with the vehement
feeling now aroused in her by this beautiful and harmless<span class="pagenum">[321]</span>
stranger. She stiffened herself to show a firm front;
self-contempt began to stir in her. Why, had it come
to this, that she, Lady Gundred Darnley, the model
of deportment and nice tact, now wished publicly to
violate her own code, to be rude and inconsiderate to a
person who on all counts, as being unobjectionable,
a fellow-guest, and an equal, claimed her consideration
and her courtesy? Such a lapse could never be permitted.
She must fight down this folly, and be kind
to Ivor Restormel through the rest of this nightmare
meal. Then she would leave the house as soon as she
could, and pray Heaven that she might never set eyes
on him again.</p>

<p>Ivor Restormel saw something strange in her manner,
but took no heed. He did not in the least care what
Lady Gundred Darnley might choose to think of him.
He felt confident that he could in no way have offended
her; further than that his interest in her attitude did
not go. The secret dislikes of one’s acquaintances are
incalculable. It is both hopeless and useless to take
such things into one’s consideration. One can but
watch one’s own behaviour to keep it clear of offence,
and then leave the rest to Providence.</p>

<p>‘Brakelond must be wonderfully beautiful,’ continued
Ivor Restormel, amiably manufacturing conversation
in the pause made by Gundred’s sudden lapse
into silence, ‘judging by the view of it from here. I
have never seen anything so fairy-like and splendid.
I suppose you have rebuilt the burnt part long ago?
All wood, you say it was? Yes, I have heard so much
of that old wing that I feel as if I knew it well, every
step and winding of it. Ugh! what a ghastly death-trap!’
Again he shuddered at his vivid recollections
of a place he had never seen.</p>

<p>Any criticism on her family or its possessions always
roused Gundred to polite animosity. Now the feeling<span class="pagenum">[322]</span>
came to her rescue, and armed her against this dreadful
young man who seemed so pleasant and innocuous.</p>

<p>‘It was very interesting and wonderful,’ she answered
reprovingly. ‘We all loved it. But, of course, wood
is always rather a peril&mdash;yes? Oak panelling is most
delightful, but one cannot help feeling it a responsibility.’</p>

<p>‘I hate the very idea of it,’ replied the other with
fervour. ‘Why, whenever I think of those wooden
rooms at Brakelond, I can smell that horrible cold,
old, acrid smell of a burnt-out ruin&mdash;the horrible smell
of charred wood, which gets into one’s nostrils and
one’s throat. Sometimes in my life I have had to
meet that smell, and whenever I get a whiff of it, I
always have a vision of the wing at Brakelond, all
wrecked and blackened and fallen in, haunted by the
dreadful acid fumes of stale fire and smoke.’</p>

<p>Gundred might have protested further against the
quite uncalled-for vigour of Ivor Restormel’s memory,
but at that moment Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright was making
efforts to capture her attention from behind a bower
of odontoglossums. She smiled her acquiescence,
made some indifferent remark to her neighbour, and
rose to head the departing procession. Thank Heaven,
the ordeal was over, and she had come out of it safely,
without any more loss of self-respect than was involved
in the conception of so incalculable an instinct of
hostility. Gundred felt her self-complacency returning.
She knew that it does not matter what sentiments one
may entertain, so long as one gives no sign of entertaining
them. One’s private blemishes are one’s own
private concern alone, provided that one does not let
one’s clothes slip down and reveal them to the world.</p>

<p>Her husband, meanwhile, at the other end of the
table had proved but a tame and uninteresting companion
to Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright. His attention<span class="pagenum">[323]</span>
throughout the meal had been fixed at every possible
moment on Gundred’s right-hand partner. For whole
long minutes he scanned that keen, handsome face.
Where had he seen it before? Why did he find it so
very much more attractive than even its own intrinsic
beauty warranted? He stared at it, analyzed it,
dissected its features. No, collectively and separately
they were quite new to him. He grew more and more
confident that he had never met the young fellow
before; otherwise he must have remembered him.
It was not a face to be forgotten. No, he had never
seen it before. And yet the imperious conviction grew
and deepened in him that that face was worn by no
stranger&mdash;that he and the boy at the end of the table
were in some mysterious way the oldest of intimate
friends. Many years before he had felt the same
passion of recognition when he at last understood what
it was he felt for Isabel; now the same haunting sense
of old acquaintance returned to him, and held him in a
firm and inexorable grip. As soon as the women had
all left the room, he carried round his glass, and settled
himself decisively at Ivor Restormel’s side, thereby
upsetting all the post-prandial arrangements, which
had been meant to make him the prey of more interesting
and conspicuous men among the guests.</p>

<p>‘We met on the road this afternoon, I think,’ said
Kingston; ‘or, rather, I passed you. You refused to
accept a lift.’</p>

<p>Ivor Restormel smiled back at him.</p>

<p>‘It was awfully good of you,’ he replied. ‘I have
never been offered a lift by a motor before. But, you
see, I was so close to Restormel, it would hardly have
been worth while.’</p>

<p>‘Are you staying here?’ inquired Kingston, more
and more strongly drawn to this new acquaintance.</p>

<p>‘Yes; Jack Hoope-Arkwright is a great friend of<span class="pagenum">[324]</span>
mine. We are at Oxford together. And, besides, I
belong here in a sort of way. The place used to be my
people’s. I am Ivor Restormel.’</p>

<p>The name instantly brought back to Kingston’s
mind that deadly accident which had eventually been
the secondary cause of Isabel’s death. He shuddered.
But the link of recollection thus forged seemed to
bind him more closely to young Restormel. The boy
had an inexplicably strong fascination. He was
pleasant, he was good-looking, he was well built; but
there was something else. He was more attractive
than all these good qualities could have made him.
Kingston took an increasing pleasure in hearing him
speak.</p>

<p>‘I remember all about you,’ answered the older man.
‘My wife used to know your mother well. It was my
wife you have been sitting next to. Perhaps she told
you how she used to know your people.’</p>

<p>Kingston knew Gundred’s devoted loyalty to all old
friends and neighbours, and was anxious to impress
Ivor Restormel’s identity upon her, foreseeing that it
would incline her favourably to his sudden plan of
seeing as much as possible of the young fellow.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Lady Gundred soon recognised who I was.
But I am afraid she was a little disappointed in me. I
think I could see it.’</p>

<p>Kingston was slightly alarmed. He knew Gundred’s
prejudices of old&mdash;soft and mild as milk; hard, ineluctable
as iron.</p>

<p>‘Oh, nonsense!’ he replied, with more anxiety than
the occasion appeared to warrant. ‘My wife is always
a little cool and non-committal when she meets people
for the first time. You will soon get accustomed to
her.’</p>

<p>It never occurred to him that he was apparently
explaining his wife, more or less apologetically, to a<span class="pagenum">[325]</span>
total stranger. Ivor Restormel was puzzled. His
beauty had already made him many sudden friends,
had immensely helped him on his way through life,
predisposing everyone in his favour; but it had never
yet kindled such a fire of zeal as seemed to be developing
in Mr. Darnley. He was inclined to be cautious in
acceptance, and during the rest of the meal gave
careful, quiet answers to Kingston’s advances. But
Kingston had not the faintest interest in the boy’s
beauty, nor, precisely, in the boy himself. It was
the acquaintance, the old friend in him, that Kingston
divined so keenly, and was eager to investigate more
fully. The vehement attraction that he felt towards
Ivor Restormel was something, so to speak, impersonal,
something quite unconnected with the boy’s pleasant
manners or agreeable face. It was an attraction
towards something deep and hidden in the young
fellow’s personality, and the attraction grew stronger
and clearer with every minute of their dialogue.</p>

<p>At last the time came to go into the drawing-room.
The men rose, and drifted in knots towards the door.
Kingston, as he went, retained possession of young
Restormel, despite the evident anxiety of Mr. Hoope-Arkwright
and Sir Nigel to have a word with Lady
Gundred’s husband.</p>

<p>‘Look here,’ he said. ‘How long are you staying
with the Hoope-Arkwrights? Come over to Brakelond,
will you? Come over to-morrow. I should like
you to see the place.’</p>

<p>Ivor Restormel accepted the unexpected invitation
with thanks. Jack Hoope-Arkwright, following in
their wake, wondered at the precipitate friendliness
of Mr. Darnley. Such sudden hospitality was by no
means in the traditions of Brakelond. A long preliminary
purification was generally necessary before
Lady Gundred considered her friends well tested<span class="pagenum">[326]</span>
enough to be invited to the Castle. And here was Ivor
Restormel, after half an hour’s acquaintance, not only
asked, but pressed to come, and to come as soon as
possible. Times were changing indeed. It had taken
the Hoope-Arkwrights three years to know the Darnleys,
and eight to be dined with by them.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening passed without event. Gundred,
however, gradually grew displeased with her
surroundings. At first she had duly been throned on
the best sofa, and listened to in silent admiration while
she pronounced on the weather, the decadence of decorum
in the servants’ hall, and the proper management
of cooks. But ere long Lady Pope, whom, in
her mind, Gundred characterized as a pushing young
person, had begun to cut in frivolously, irreverently,
with jokes and stories. Gundred, who had a faint
instinct that all wit was more or less vulgar, did her
best to repress these interruptions; but her efforts
were vain, and soon even her devout hostess was
listening and laughing at Lady Pope’s sallies. Lady
Gundred was left rather out of the picture, and her
authoritative comments on cooks began to lose their
hold on the general attention. Then when the men
appeared it was even worse. Lady Pope became the
centre of a court; even those who came to make their
dutiful obeisance to Lady Gundred passed hastily on,
after a few pallid words about the weather, to join the
cheerful crowd round the younger woman. Then
games were played, largely at Lady Pope’s instigation;
and Gundred, who would have disliked any proposal
that sprung from one whom she now felt herself compelled
to regard, however disdainfully, as a rival,
had, further, personal reasons for disapproving this
development. For she sang; and she expected, accordingly,
to be asked to sing. Her music was waiting
outside to be fetched; it would have been obviously<span class="pagenum">[327]</span>
proper of Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright to press her most
important guest to perform. But apparently everyone
preferred the thoughtless gaiety of this unprofitable
evening to hearing Lady Gundred discoursing
Chaminade in her neat and well-drilled little flute of a
voice, which, as her friends said in extenuation, was so
truly wonderful for a woman of forty.</p>

<p>Finally, to add to all these annoyances, she saw her
husband neglecting everyone else in the room to talk
to that young man for whom she had conceived such
a repulsion. She would rather, even, have seen him
spending the time in attendance on that forward Lady
Pope. But Kingston was so distressingly friendly.
Actuated by many collaborating motives, Gundred
made haste to ask for her carriage, and showed every
sign of imminent departure, much to the distress of
hospitable Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright. Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright
felt that the evening had not been altogether
satisfactory since dinner. Lady Pope had evidently
shone excessively; and the light of Lady Gundred
Darnley had been thereby most unjustly dimmed. It
grew plain that Lady Gundred was a little put out.
Gaiety and dignity were hard to combine. Lady
Pope offered the gaiety; Lady Gundred the dignity.
And the two ambitions were irreconcilable; for it was
already clear that Lady Gundred could not amuse&mdash;certainly
not while Lady Pope was of the party.
Grievously did Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright regret that she
had infused the gay and sparkling element of the
young woman into what she had meant to be the
serene if soporific delights of a dinner made illustrious
by the presence of March and Brakelond. But it was
now too late for regret, and no entreaties could soften
Lady Gundred’s determination to go.</p>

<p>‘Thanks so much,’ said Gundred sweetly. ‘Such
a delightful evening. We have enjoyed ourselves so<span class="pagenum">[328]</span>
much. But we must really think of the horses.
Good-night, Mrs. Hoope-Arkwright. Good-night&mdash;good-night&mdash;good-night.’</p>

<p>Scattering bows and farewell condescension like a
queen, the Lady Gundred Darnley moved towards the
hall. Kingston obediently followed her, and soon the
door of the brougham was shut upon them, and they
were off. Gundred smoothed out her flounce with a
certain pettishness unusual to her calm temperament.</p>

<p>‘A dreadful house,’ she said decisively, ‘so horribly
rich and new&mdash;and the most vulgar and trying people.
One wonders how even the Hoope-Arkwrights contrive
to collect such a crew. Surely, Kingston, I could not
have heard you asking one of them to come to Brakelond?
Just as we were leaving. It must have been
my fancy, of course.’ She was sitting very upright,
rigid with rectitude, her pale lips compressed, her pale
eyes gleaming scornfully. Kingston felt like a guilty
child.</p>

<p>‘Only young Restormel,’ he said. ‘You will like
him, Gundred. I am sure you will like him immensely.
He is one of the most attractive people I have ever
met. After all, he is an old neighbour of yours, not
like the Hoope-Arkwrights and the rest of their
friends. I made him promise to come over to-morrow.
And then, later on, he might come to stay with us for
a bit. I should like you to see more of him, Gundred.
He will be someone for you to help and befriend.’</p>

<p>A very long silence, leaden and ominous, filled the
brougham. Then Gundred spoke, in a bland, deliberate
low voice.</p>

<p>‘Really, Kingston,’ she said, ‘you are almost
trying at times.’</p>

<p>Her husband felt himself annihilated. This, from
Gundred, was very heavy rebuke. He made no answer,
and they drove on to Brakelond without another word.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[329]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>


<p>Gundred, however, was too good a wife to make
useless difficulties. As her husband had invited this
young man, this young man must clearly be endured.
After all, the visit would soon be over, and she herself
need not put in more than a bare appearance. To
tell the truth, she was not quite easy as to her own
attitude in the matter. It could not be altogether
right to conceive such violent antipathies, and she
was painfully surprised to find herself entertaining
such a feeling. She told herself that there could be
no smoke without fire, and that sooner or later her
infallible female instinct would be found justified.
But until it should be so found justified, she was far
too conscientiously good a woman to be happy in the
indulgence of an unreasonable hatred. Accordingly,
she deliberately suppressed her annoyance, and made it
her penance to receive Ivor Restormel on the morrow
with her usual quiet grace. The effort brought its own
reward; dislike him mysteriously, instinctively, she still
did and always would, but there was no longer the uncomfortable
vehemence about the feeling. She could
tolerate him, though she could not make him welcome.</p>

<p>Ivor Restormel walked over in the afternoon.
Gundred gave him tea and then left him to her husband’s
care, on the plea of a post to catch. Kingston
took his guest into the new wing that had been built
on the promontory after the fire, and proceeded to
question him and talk to him more exhaustively than
had been possible the night before amid the exigencies
of a party, no matter how scandalously disregarded.
There was no beginning about their friendship, it
seemed to Kingston, no breaking of new ground. It
was simply the picking up of a dropped thread where<span class="pagenum">[330]</span>
it had fallen. The feeling was strange and almost
uncanny, the more so that it was evidently not shared
by Ivor Restormel. He received his host’s overtures
with diffidence, seemed ill at ease, at a loss to understand
the warmth of his treatment. Mr. Darnley was
nothing more to him than a chance acquaintance of
the night before. As the dialogue went forward, too,
the visitor’s uneasiness became more and more marked.
His face took on a strange look of strain and anxiety;
in his speech could be heard from time to time that note
of abstraction which can be heard in a voice whose
owner is trying hard to keep up a conversation, while
his mind is fixed far away on the contemplation of
unpleasant private matters. Kingston watched the
expression of his guest’s eyes, the curious hunted fear
that his whole manner began to suggest, and again
experienced more strongly than ever the mysterious
feeling of having seen that manner, that strained expression,
somewhere before. His memory must be
playing him the maddest tricks; for he could have
sworn that this boy was well known to him in every
detail of face and disposition; yet by now it was
clearly proved&mdash;as clearly proved, at least, as anything
in this world could ever be&mdash;that the two had never
met, and never even set eyes on each other before.
But Kingston still hoped against hope that a chance
discovery in the dialogue might reveal some hint or
glimpse of a former meeting, however brief, partial,
trifling. Thus, and thus alone, could his instinct be
justified.</p>

<p>But, as the conversation went forward, the visitor’s
uneasiness grew keener and more unsettling. At last
it could no longer be controlled.</p>

<p>‘I should awfully like to see some more of the Castle,’
he said. ‘You said something last night about showing
me the pictures.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[331]</span></p>

<p>But the boy’s evident wish to move was too interesting
to be gratified. Kingston saw it, could not
understand it, meant to understand it.</p>

<p>‘Oh, there will be heaps of time,’ he replied. ‘You
must come over again some afternoon. But it takes
at least a day to see the Castle thoroughly. We may
just as well stay here peacefully. Really, these are
the most comfortable rooms in the whole building,
although they are quite modern.’</p>

<p>‘Modern, are they?’ answered young Restormel.
It was a silly answer, and betrayed the inattention of
his mind. For the rooms were too obviously modern
for any comment on the fact to be other than fatuous.</p>

<p>‘Yes, they were only built about&mdash;yes, twenty
years ago.’</p>

<p>Ivor Restormel leapt to his feet. His anxiety
culminated, seemed mysteriously confirmed. His eyes
were filled with a horror he was trying to conceal.
‘Surely,’ he stammered, ‘these are not the rooms that
were restored after the&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘After the fire? Yes. This was where the old
wing stood.’</p>

<p>‘I thought so; I knew they must be,’ replied Ivor
Restormel with forced calm. ‘And they have not
got rid of the smell yet. I noticed it as soon as I got
inside.’</p>

<p>‘The smell! What smell?’ asked his host, amused
by this odd notion of his visitor’s, and sniffing about
for the aroma of dead rats.</p>

<p>‘The smell of fire,’ said Ivor Restormel, speaking in
a low voice, as of a thing too dreadful to be talked
of in normal tones. ‘The whole place is full of the
smell of fire. Don’t you notice it, Mr. Darnley? I
suppose nothing can be on fire now? No; it is the
stale old smell of a fire that has been out for a long
time&mdash;the sharp, beastly smell of charred wood and<span class="pagenum">[332]</span>
burnt stone. I know it so well.’ He shivered against
his will.</p>

<p>Kingston was startled at this strange new development.
He had heard nothing of Ivor Restormel’s
hidden horror. Gundred had disliked the whole subject
too much to tattle about it. Kingston was
astounded at the sudden fantastic anxiety of his
guest, the perturbation of his manners, his evident
discomposure. So vivid was Ivor Restormel’s apprehension
that it even impressed itself on Kingston.
The host inhaled the air sharply. There was not the
faintest suggestion of fire or smoke. The room was
sleepily fragrant with potpourri from the old perforated
jade censer on the corner table. Otherwise
there was nothing in the air. And yet it was evident
that Ivor Restormel was dodging some secret terror
that was almost on the point of breaking covert and
declaring itself.</p>

<p>‘You have got a most wonderful imagination,’ said
Kingston at last. ‘There is no smell of fire here. On
my word, there isn’t. There couldn’t be. The fire
was put out twenty years ago, hang it all! The
smell of it could not very well be hanging about here
still.’</p>

<p>‘No; I suppose not,’ answered the other, obviously
quite unconvinced.</p>

<p>Then, lamely, hesitatingly, he explained the reasons
why the memories of the catastrophe at Brakelond
had become so closely involved with his own life, and
what a troublesome legacy it had left him through the
shock that his mother had suffered. Kingston was
more and more stirred.</p>

<p>‘I never heard anything more extraordinary,’ he
replied. ‘Suggestion, I suppose it must be. And
this room makes you feel uncomfortable even now, I
can see, and you manage to smell fire where there<span class="pagenum">[333]</span>
has been no fire for twenty years. And yet you have
no more recollections?’</p>

<p>‘Recollections? I don’t quite know what there
could be for me to recollect.’</p>

<p>‘Well, to tell you the truth, when I first saw you on
the road, I had a vague and yet a very strong feeling
that you and I have met before, and known each other
quite well. I imagine that was all a mistake? See
if you can’t remember any previous meeting between
us, though. It would be interesting if you could, for
my instinct was quite extraordinarily clear on the
point, though my memory seems to say accurately and
definitely that I had never seen your face till I passed
you in the car yesterday afternoon.’</p>

<p>Ivor Restormel shook his head positively, and made
haste to answer in the negative. The question did not
interest him in the least. The one feeling of which he
was conscious was his tyrannous need of getting away
from those serene and pleasant modern rooms, which,
to his excited fancy, seemed full of horrid ghosts.</p>

<p>‘No,’ he said. ‘I am pretty well certain we can
never have met before. I was brought up abroad, you
see, by my mother, after they sold Restormel. And
the last two or three years I have been living at Oxford.
I have not been to London or anywhere where we could
have met. No&mdash;no.... I say, I am a most awful
idiot to-day. I can’t imagine what has come over
me,’ he cried abruptly. ‘But this jolly room of yours&mdash;well,
it feels to me horribly uncanny. You say there
is no fire, and of course there isn’t; yet the smell is
in my nostrils and my throat all the time, choking and
stifling me. Did you ever hear such rot? Do you
mind if we go out in the garden or somewhere? I’m
not often taken like this, please believe me. I have
never felt anything like this in my life. I told you how
I hate and dread fire, though I have never suffered<span class="pagenum">[334]</span>
from it; but nothing has ever given me such an awful
impression of fire as I feel here to-day.’</p>

<p>He had been standing ever since he rose from his
chair, or walking uneasily from end to end of the room.
Now he stood in front of his host, gazing at him with
eyes which, for all his tongue’s pretence at ease, were
filled with a haunting dread. Kingston was deeply
moved by the spectacle of this fighting terror before
him. The terror moved his pity, the courage of its
victim moved his admiration. And, behind everything
else lay the curiosity that this manifestation
woke in him. But he could no longer disregard his
visitor’s eagerness to be gone elsewhere. He rose
from the window-seat.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry,’ he said. ‘I cannot understand it.
Yes, let us go, if you wish. We might take a turn in
the garden. I would not have brought you in here if
I had had the slightest idea that you feel like this. But
I never could have believed that such a stretch of
imagination was possible.’ Kingston broke off, studying
the controlled fear in the young man’s face. Then
he abruptly began again. ‘Look here,’ he said, ‘do
tell me exactly what it is you see and feel that gets
on your nerves so. I cannot understand it.’</p>

<p>Ivor Restormel glanced round the room. Under
Gundred’s supervision it had been rebuilt in a cool and
placid modern style. Everything in it was pretty,
graceful, harmonious. The walls were panelled in
white; flowers were standing about in tall blue glasses.
The big windows admitted shafts of soft afternoon
light through their drawn white blinds, and the whole
impression was one of fragrant, comfortable peace.</p>

<p>But Ivor Restormel’s eyes saw something very
different.</p>

<p>After a pause he answered, huskily, in broken,
difficult tones:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[335]</span></p>

<p>‘You will think me more of an ass than you do
already,’ he replied. ‘I suppose it must be my
mother’s stories that account for it. But, besides the
awful smell of burning here, I seem to see a horrible
wreckage of charred ruins. Oh, I can see these walls
and all the jolly decorations. And yet, somehow,
when I look again they are not there any longer. There
is only the shell of some other building, something all
fallen in and blistered and blackened with fire. Great
heaps of ashes and bleached rubbish are piled high
between what is left of the walls. The whole place is
choking with the stale fumes of smoke. And the
rooms are open to the grey sky far overhead; and grey
drifts of rain come dashing in from time to time on
the smouldering masses.’</p>

<p>Kingston watched his visitor’s face with an amazement
that bereft him of words.</p>

<p>‘By God!’ he said slowly, wondering where his
thoughts would lead him in the next few minutes.
‘By God! you describe it exactly as if you had been
here twenty years ago.’</p>

<p>Ivor Restormel shook his head fiercely, as if trying
to shake off some horrid, persistent memory.</p>

<p>‘I feel as if I had,’ he replied suddenly. ‘I feel just
as if I had been here twenty years ago, worse luck.
The moment I came into the room I saw it all. I felt&mdash;oh,
well, I felt that I must have been here in the ruins
ever so long ago, and had the worst time here that
anyone ever had&mdash;as if I had been tied by the leg here,
somehow, and pinned down in damnable terror and
pain.’</p>

<p>‘Come along out of it,’ said Kingston quietly, after
a pause. He dared not trust himself to say more. An
idea had been born in his brain&mdash;born, or called once
more to life?&mdash;an idea so wild, so fantastic, that he
hardly dared to entertain it. And yet, in the depths<span class="pagenum">[336]</span>
of his heart, he knew that it was the truth. In silence
he led the way towards the Castle, while his visitor
tried to impress upon his unheeding ears a dozen
apologies for the gross and idiotic folly of which his
nerves had made him guilty.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of the fateful room all his self-possession
seemed to have returned, and he could not
account for the sudden vertigo of terror that had
haunted him there. What had come over him he could
not imagine. Mr. Darnley must certainly think him
the most confounded idiot. What must Mr. Darnley
think of anyone who could let himself be made such a
rude, mannerless idiot of by a sort of hysterical schoolgirl
qualm? The whole thing was too asinine for
words. He had no excuse to make.</p>

<p>And all the time Mr. Darnley said nothing, heard
nothing of his guest’s protestations. This beautiful
nervous boy had no interest for Kingston Darnley;
he did not care what he said or felt or looked like.
But the terror that haunted Ivor Restormel was not
his; the mysterious attraction that filled him was not
his own. Somewhere, deep down in his being, lived
Something that had felt that terror, Something that
exercised that attraction over Kingston, Something
that called to Kingston as an old friend. And that
Something, Kingston knew it, heard it calling to him
imperiously out of the eternal past. It was the Something
that had once carried the name and shape of
Isabel. There was no mistaking it. Now at last
Kingston understood what it was that had gripped him
yesterday on the road, what inexplicable summons of
old friendship. The dead had come back to him after
many years. But clothed in alien flesh, forming part
of a new personality, shut off from recognition by the
barriers of the body. For in this boy lived only the
one fragmentary recollection of the final catastrophe.<span class="pagenum">[337]</span>
Nothing in Kingston’s soul, no call of ancient kinship,
no appeal to bygone pledges, could penetrate to the
ears of that secret self. The dead had come back,
known to him, but incapable of knowing him again.
How could he wake memory in that changed thing
which had returned, at once the same, and yet so
different, in its freedom from that bond which once had
made them one, and now, still as strong as ever in the
hold it had over himself, had broken and fallen away
for ever from the other soul it had gripped? Kingston
looked at his visitor with a feeling that drew near to
hatred. This stranger held the thing he still loved.
The body and the shape of it was an irrelevant, a
maddening accident; it was the secret thing that Kingston
called to, the secret thing that was prevented
from hearing by this new personality in which it had
clothed itself. Kingston felt a sharp grudge against
Ivor Restormel, his body, his brain, his beauty. That
body, that brain, that beauty made the locked casket
that imprisoned the living dead. And yet, inasmuch
as Ivor Restormel was the shrine of that lost passion,
he was, on the other hand, ineffably precious and
sacred. He could not be let go. The boy himself
was less than nothing; but what he held was more
than everything.</p>

<p>Ivor Restormel thought his host justifiably offended,
and tried to mitigate the effect of his own silly rudeness.
But his pleasant chatter fell on unheeding
ears, and he began to think that he had alienated
Mr. Darnley beyond reconciliation. And no wonder.
Who could be expected to put up with a puling idiot
like that? Ivor Restormel mentally kicked himself,
and felt that he would gladly have vindicated his
character by returning into those haunted rooms.
Without having any special wish to please either of
the Darnleys, he was one of those people who always<span class="pagenum">[338]</span>
like to be popular, and grow faintly unhappy when they
fail to make a favourable impression. He did all he
could to mollify his host, and was distressed, though
not surprised, to find all his efforts fall flat. In
ordinary circumstances he would not have minded
so much; but now he felt that he really owed Mr.
Darnley some extra pleasantness, if only to make up
for having just made so egregious an ass of himself.
He tried his level best to set matters right; but for
a long time he got no answer&mdash;or at most an absent-minded
monosyllable. Kingston was not yet equal to
conversing with this tiresome young interloper who
had come between himself and the dead, while, at the
same time, revealing at last to him the return of the
lost. They walked in silence up and down the garden
together, while Gundred watched them from an upper
window, disliking the visitor as much as ever, and
wondering when in the world he would begin to think
about going.</p>

<p>‘Wanted to see the pictures, didn’t you?’ said
Kingston abruptly at last, cutting, regardless, into
something that the other was saying.</p>

<p>Ivor Restormel felt more and more out of place.
Evidently he would do well to say good-bye. However,
he could not escape from this civility of his host,
however perfunctory. So he followed Kingston as he
strode into the Castle, paying no attention to the boy
at his heels. Gradually Kingston was beginning to
recover his composure and face the inevitable. This
wonderful secret certainty of his must be cherished
and acted on, though already he began to taste something
of the pain that had been foretold him, from incessant
yearning knowledge of a thing that could not
recognise him in turn, and could never recognise him
again. The door between them was of locked iron&mdash;a
vain agony to beat against. And yet it was not an<span class="pagenum">[339]</span>
agony that he could spare himself, for, though the
door was of locked iron for ever, yet behind it dwelt
the thing he had sought for so long. He saw now the
irony of his fate. But nothing could divert its course.
Ivor Restormel found his host growing calmer and
more courteous again. Soon he was even cordial, and
the tension of the situation seemed at an end. The
two men passed through the picture-gallery, giving a
share of attention to every picture, though each, in
reality, was busy with his own thoughts, Ivor feeling
the satisfaction of successful effort, and Kingston foreboding
the anguish of an effort that could never be
successful. At last they had gone the length of the
gallery, and stood before the old panel of Queen Isabel.</p>

<p>‘Here is the She-wolf,’ said Kingston pleasantly.
‘Don’t you think she looks her name? Isabel of
France and England.’</p>

<p>The younger man laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he answered. ‘An evil lady, I suppose? It
is curious what a horror I have of the very name.
Isabel&mdash;it seems to stand to me for everything I hate
most in the world, fire included. I must have some
beastly memory somewhere connected with the name
of Isabel, but I cannot lay my hands upon it.’</p>

<p>The little artless admission roused Kingston to the
highest point of excitement. He must penetrate to
the secret haunt of that soul which had such clear
flashes of recognition. The task <em>must</em> not be hopeless.
He turned almost savagely upon his guest.</p>

<p>‘Restormel,’ he said, ‘what do you mean by that?
For God’s sake, think&mdash;think hard, and tell me what
you mean by that. Think, man, think.’</p>

<p>The vehemence of his attack, however, had no effect
upon the younger man. Kingston had hoped that by
its sheer sudden intensity it must inevitably strike a
chord of memory, must inevitably rouse up the sleeping<span class="pagenum">[340]</span>
soul with its cry of eagerness. But it failed&mdash;failed
utterly, and his mood fell back baffled.</p>

<p>‘I’d tell you if I could,’ protested Ivor. ‘But, upon
my soul, I can’t. It is just another of my idiotic
crazes. I wish I had not told you now. It only
makes one seem more of an ass than one did before.
Anyhow, I think I must be getting back to Restormel,
Mr. Darnley. Thanks so much for letting me come
over. I have awfully enjoyed seeing the Castle.
Will you say good-bye for me to Lady Gundred?’</p>

<p>‘Look here,’ said Kingston, suddenly kindled to
anxiety by this threat of departure&mdash;‘look here.
What are you going to do, Restormel, when you leave
the Hoope-Arkwrights? I mean, what are your
plans in life?’</p>

<p>‘Mine? Oh, well, I hardly know. I have got to
make some money somehow. There isn’t a penny-piece
for us to live on. I shall have to be a clerk, or
something of the kind, I imagine. My mother sent me
to Oxford because she wanted me to make my living
by teaching. But it does not seem that there is much
chance of that nowadays. The world swarms with
tutors and masters.’</p>

<p>Kingston saw his chance. It was unthinkable that
this recovered joy of his life should be allowed to pass
away again immediately, leaving him in the darkness
that he had endured for twenty years. He could not
bear the thought of parting with Ivor Restormel.
The very notion was a pain.</p>

<p>‘But look here,’ he said abruptly, ‘why not come to
us and be my secretary, and do tutor to my son Jim,
perhaps, in the holidays? I am sure we should all get
on capitally together, and, honestly, I don’t think that
you could easily pick up anything much better. And
we’d do our best for you. What do you say?’</p>

<p>Ivor, confounded at this sudden proposition, the<span class="pagenum">[341]</span>
last thing that he had expected after his behaviour of
that afternoon, lost himself in thanks and self-depreciation.
Kingston would hear of no such hesitations.</p>

<p>‘We might just as well settle it now,’ he said.
‘There’s nothing to consider much, or think over&mdash;that
is, if you really care to try this kind of work.
You know about us, and we know about you; and, so
far as we are concerned, I don’t see that anything could
possibly have fallen out more conveniently.’</p>

<p>‘But I&mdash;do you think I should be able to do what
you want?’ asked Ivor Restormel. ‘Remember,
please, I have never attempted anything of the sort
before. You may not find me what you like, after all.’</p>

<p>‘One knows that sort of thing as well at the end of
five minutes, very often, as at the end of five years.
I am quite certain that you are exactly the sort of
fellow we want. I knew it the first moment we met.
So don’t make any more difficulties or apologies, but
just say that you will come to us.’</p>

<p>‘But of course, if you really think&mdash;well, I shall be
delighted, of course.’</p>

<p>‘That’s right. And there’s no particular reason for
putting things off, is there? So come to us as soon
as you can. To-morrow, or the day after. You won’t
want to stay much longer with those Hoope-Arkwright
people. And I should like you to get accustomed to
us and the place before we go off to my place in Yorkshire
and our son Jim comes home.’</p>

<p>And so, after a few more faint demurrings, Ivor
Restormel, bewildered and dazed by the rapid development
of events, found himself pledged to take up his
residence at Brakelond with the least possible delay.
Matters being thus settled to Kingston’s satisfaction,
he allowed his visitor to depart, and then began to
brace himself to the task of breaking his latest plan to
Gundred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[342]</span></p>

<p>The good wife neither raves nor flouts. But, if she
be good enough, she has the power of being quite
wonderfully disagreeable in a mild and dutiful manner.
Gundred had never countered Kingston with any ill-bred
vehemence, but by now he knew that on occasions
she could don a pious resignation inexpressibly
hard to bear. Some such display, he was afraid, might
greet his announcement, for, to his experienced eye, it
was already plain that she did not approve of Ivor
Restormel. Her sweetness to him had had a certain
glacial tone which Kingston well knew. He anticipated
that she might make difficulties.</p>

<p>But events were moving too rapidly for Gundred’s
orderly habit of mind. She was too much taken aback
when she heard the arrangement that her husband
had made to offer any coherent or valid opposition.
A vague passion of wrath possessed her, and her anger
lost half its efficacy with all its usual crushing calm.
For Gundred, the imperturbably gentle and correct,
so far forgot herself as to combat Kingston’s plan with
violent obloquy. Never before had he seen her unreasonable,
or hysterically bellicose; and the unusual
spectacle, so far from compelling his sympathy, only
hardened his decision by its contrast with her usual
well-regulated temper. Had a glimpse of the past
been vouchsafed to him, after all these years, that he
should now forego the agonizing joy of it, simply
because his wife chose to abandon herself to a groundless
antipathy against a young man, a perfect stranger,
in whom she, of all people, could certainly not discern
that inmost inhabitant whose presence gave him so
strong a claim on Kingston? No, her foolishness
justified him in disregarding her opposition.</p>

<p>As for Gundred, she lost her head, lost it completely,
in the complete surprise that overwhelmed her. Imagining
that a meal or so at Brakelond would mark<span class="pagenum">[343]</span>
the extent of her husband’s ridiculous fancy for the
boy against whom her instinct so urgently warned her,
she had been content to allow matters their course,
considering resistance unnecessary. And now, while
she acquiesced, matters had suddenly grown to such
a pitch that resistance was no longer possible. The
situation had passed beyond her control. At first she
could hardly believe that Kingston really meant to
disregard her hostility. Hitherto, through all their
married life, husband and wife had never seriously
clashed. A quiet tolerance towards each other’s plans
had marked their relations. In fact, neither had really
been sufficiently excited over the other’s actions ever
to make a fuss. They trusted each other, and lived
in the amity of confident indifference. Ideal as their
union had been, though, it had been the union of two
parts, not fused, but cemented; now at last, after
twenty years, surged up the hot water of opposition,
and in the moment of trial the cement revealed itself
by melting. At a touch the two lives fell apart, and
were separate once more. The revelation was a shock
to Gundred.</p>

<p>‘Kingston,’ she cried, ‘I tell you, I distrust that
young man. I cannot think what you mean by proposing
to have him in the house. The very moment
I set eyes on him I felt that there was something wrong
about him. A woman’s instinct is never mistaken,
Kingston.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t be so ridiculous, Gundred,’ answered her
husband. ‘Have you anything definite to say? If
so, say it, by all means, and we’ll think no more of the
matter. But if you have not, don’t dishonour yourself
by making scenes and abusing a young fellow of
whom you know nothing but what is perfectly good.’</p>

<p>‘And Jim?’ replied Gundred, taken at a disadvantage,
and stripped in an instant of the lovely calm that<span class="pagenum">[344]</span>
usually clothed her like a Paquin frock&mdash;‘my Jim?
Am I to see my only child, Kingston, handed over to
the company of a man against whom I have the very
strongest feelings of fear and horror? Kingston, I
tell you I look on that young man with positive fear
and horror. Have I ever said anything like this
before about anyone else? Do you think I am mad
enough and unchristian enough to take prejudices
like this without a reason? But it is stronger than
I am, this feeling. It is so strong that I feel it would
be wicked to disregard it. It is Heaven’s warning to
us all. I know that it speaks the truth, Kingston;
don’t be so obstinate.’</p>

<p>Knowing in his secret heart what secret tie it was
that bound him to the occupant of Ivor Restormel’s
personality, Kingston could not but feel it strange
and impressive that Gundred should have conceived
so violent and instinctive animosity against the young
fellow. Could it be a blind feeling of jealousy, recrudescent
from the past? Anyhow, it was the very
devil and all of an inconvenience. And, as no sort
of wrong was meditated to Gundred, as no sort of
wrong was possible, Kingston saw clearly that her unreasonableness
not only allowed him, but enjoined
him, in her own interests, to take a firm way of dealing
with these hysterical passions. Had she been cool
and staid as usual, he would have found the situation
much more difficult to cope with; as it was, her dishevelled
zeal gave him the advantage, and enabled
him to assume the high position of one who has right
and reason on his side.</p>

<p>‘Hang it all, Gundred,’ he protested. ‘What a
piece of work to make about nothing! One would
have thought you would have been only too glad to
help an old neighbour’s son. You are generally so
keen to do what you can for people. Do try and get<span class="pagenum">[345]</span>
over these absurd fancies. Do you suppose I am not
just as anxious as you are that Jim shall be kept out
of undesirable hands? Come, you don’t think me a
fool, I hope? You don’t imagine that I should pick
out a scoundrel for a whim? I tell you, I like this
young fellow; I like him more than I can say. He
attracts me strongly; I am sure we shall find him a
great addition.’</p>

<p>Gundred looked up at him with righteous wrath in
her eyes. ‘He must have bewitched you,’ she said,
devoutly and sincerely. ‘The Forces of Evil sometimes
have the most awful power. Oh, Kingston, listen to
me. Be wise, and repent in time. Oh, I never
thought it would come to this. Why, <em>why</em> did we
ever dine with those dreadful people?’</p>

<p>‘Gundred, you are either hysterical or medieval.
And in either case, really one cannot argue with you.
I have never seen you like this before. Poor boy!
can you soberly think him an emissary of the devil?’
Kingston laughed.</p>

<p>But Gundred, among many other antiquated notions
in which she took pride, retained a most steadfast belief
in the bodily existence of Satan. To be old-fashioned
in manners, mind, morals&mdash;in everything but clothes&mdash;was
her especial glory. In London she claimed to
be conspicuous by her old-world excellencies. When
she met, or heard&mdash;for they did not frequent her set&mdash;of
other Dukes’ wives and daughters who were frivolous
and freethinking and modern, Gundred took
pride in asserting the obvious fact that she was not
as they, that she continued to give a rare and beautiful
example of pristine decorum to her order. Her friends
might find the spectacle dull, but they could never
deny that it was edifying. And among the old-fashioned
adornments with which she persisted in
decking her habit of mind, her belief in the Powers<span class="pagenum">[346]</span>
of evil, of witchcraft and possession, were given not
the least important place. She described herself complacently
as an old-fashioned Christian, and never
passed a palmist’s placard in Bond Street without
feeling that the law ought to have more scruples about
allowing a witch to live. Now, accordingly, she
primmed her lips fiercely at Kingston’s scepticism.</p>

<p>‘All I know is,’ she answered, ‘that these warnings
are sent us for our good, and that the Powers of Evil
are for ever round us, seeking whom they may devour.
Kingston, will you, or will you not, pay attention to
what I say?’</p>

<p>By this time her truculent attitude had dissipated
her husband’s last lingering scruples. Looked at very
minutely, very casuistically, perhaps it was not perfectly
fair to force upon Gundred someone she disliked,
simply because he himself desired to keep watch and
communion with the precious personality that dwelt
within the object of her hostility, and probably was
the unknown cause of it. But nothing of all this could
Gundred possibly know, for one thing; and, for another,
her attitude had become so grotesquely exaggerated
and defiant that no husband of any sense or spirit
could be justified in giving way to it. Why, the
situation was preposterous and transpontine to an
intolerable degree. His own sudden fantastic instinct
had been strange and grotesque enough, in all conscience;
but Gundred’s fury of opposition lent yet a
further touch of grotesqueness which removed the
whole episode into the domain of mystical melodrama.
Why, they might be living in a novel of Lytton or
Mortimer Collins, instead of in a very comfortable and
orderly present into which had suddenly flashed a
gleam of romance out of an equally comfortable and
orderly past. Kingston would not recognise his own
instinct as anything abnormal, and was bent on keeping<span class="pagenum">[347]</span>
all suggestion of the abnormal out of his human
relations. The prenatal memory, he knew, was not
only a fact, but a fact&mdash;at any rate, in the East,
where memory and its training are better understood
than over here&mdash;of no uncommon occurrence. There
was nothing strange in the fact that in this boy of
twenty, there should still be lurking some fragmentary
elements of the woman whose martyrdom and courage
he reincarnated. Kingston would not decorate the
situation with any romantic glamour; it was a plain,
indisputable occurrence, and his whole life should
insist on treating it as a matter of course. In his
violent resolve to keep the young fellow close at hand
there was no sentiment, no idiotic feeling of attachment
for the young man himself, or any objectionable
nonsense of that kind. The young fellow was of no
account at all. Kingston’s wish to secure his continued
presence must be put down simply prosaically, solely,
to his recognition of the fact that in the boy’s personality
the lost Isabel sometimes spoke again, and
therefore his company was doubly and trebly desirable;
but only for what it conveyed, not in the least
for what it was. And, all this being so, Kingston was
the more irritated by the instinctive knowledge of the
truth that Gundred’s absurd behaviour seemed to
hint at, the more bent on resenting it, ignoring it,
and, by determination in his own way, crushing out
the signs of resistance that she was so vehemently
showing.</p>

<p>‘Oh, let’s have no more of this, Gundred,’ he exclaimed.
‘You do not know what you are saying. I
am exceedingly sorry to annoy you, but you know you
would despise yourself and me if I gave way to such
ridiculous nightmares. You will see things quite
differently to-morrow. Do try and look at the matter
more sensibly.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[348]</span></p>

<p>‘Man sends sense,’ cried Gundred, ‘and God sends
instincts. Listen to God, Kingston, or you will be
sorry for it.’</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders cruelly.</p>

<p>‘There is no coping with religious exaltation,’ he
answered coldly, with a weary feeling that this woman
at his side was quite alien to him in all her thoughts
and ways.</p>

<p>Gundred rose. ‘If that is what you call it,’ she
replied, with more of her habitual dignity, ‘I think
there is no more to be said.’</p>

<p>‘I agree with you. There is nothing more to be
said.’</p>

<p>‘And this young man, Ivor Restormel, he is to come
here in a day or two?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Kingston. ‘I settled it all up with
him this afternoon.’</p>

<p>‘And you absolutely refuse to give me what I ask
for?’ went on Gundred, returning now, after the
heat of the conflict, to the impressive calm of her usual
manner. She was preparing a new attack.</p>

<p>‘My dear Gundred,’ answered her husband, more
gently now that he saw her more amenable, and therefore
more worthy of consideration, ‘I will gladly spend
the rest of my life doing what you wish, as long as you
ask me for things I can in decency do.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ replied Gundred, ‘that is what people always
say. They will do everything in the world to please
one, except the only thing one asks them for. <em>That</em> is
never reasonable or right.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it certainly was not in this case, now, was it,
Gundred&mdash;honestly, now, was it? You asked me to
throw this wretched young man over, to break my
promise to him, to upset all his plans, to cast him
adrift again after I had offered him our help. And
why? All simply because you had been bored at the<span class="pagenum">[349]</span>
Hoope-Arkwrights’ tedious dinner, and eaten something
which disagreed with you, and made you look
on all the world with a bilious, peevish eye, and on
your luckless dinner-neighbour in particular. For
that is what it all comes to, you know; that is what
your wonderful edifice of instincts and suspicions and
righteous qualms is founded on.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; you may sneer,’ answered Gundred coolly,
regaining her supremacy with her self-control. ‘It is
always very easy to sneer. Well, I see that you must
have your way; you will not listen to me. Somehow,
I feel that there is something in the boy that stands
between us&mdash;something that has been between us,
somehow, for a long time, though we did not know it,
and has now come to life again, or wakened up and set
to work moving us apart. That may be my fancy,
perhaps. I know I am upset. I am surprised and
shocked. I expected better, happier things of you,
Kingston. But this I will say, that if you won’t listen
to what you call my foolish instincts, you will be very
sorry for it some day. God will certainly punish you
for disregarding the clear message that He sent you
through me. And this obstinacy of yours will bring
its own penalty in time. I know it. I know what
you are doing is altogether wrong. And, as your wife,
I shall put up with it. But day and night I shall pray
God to remove this dreadful thing from our home. I
shall pray that something may open your eyes.’</p>

<p>Kingston smiled uneasily, to disguise the impression
that her appeal was making on his mood. ‘My dear
Gundred,’ he said. ‘Pray by all means. The prayers
of a good woman can never bring harm or pain.’</p>

<p>‘Not even if you love the harm? Not even if you
are wedded to the harm?’ asked Gundred. ‘Perhaps
they might divorce you from the harm, and then that
separation might be painful.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[350]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t talk as if you meant to put poison in
poor Ivor Restormel’s soup,’ cried Kingston, to relieve
the tension of the situation. He did not, however,
in his own conscience feel altogether easy. The
more bent was he, therefore, on laughing down his
wife’s denunciations.</p>

<p>‘God chooses His own instruments for His own purposes,’
answered Gundred earnestly. Then she rose,
her demeanour filled with tranquil decision, with a
stern majesty of protest that stirred again a twinge of
remorse in her husband’s heart. Was it she that was
foolish, or was it he that was selfish? After all, no
sort of harm was planned against her, no disloyalty of
any kind, no cooling of affection. If here and there a
boy’s chance words contained the spirit of a long-dead
woman, well, what was that to Gundred&mdash;especially as
she could never know it? And his indulgence in the
secret pleasure of those words could give no reasonable
pain to her. And yet, so long as they did give her
pain, did it very much matter whether the pain were
reasonable or not, as far as the inflictor’s innocence or
guilt was concerned? For what pain in the world
is reasonable, if one looks far into the causes and the
future of things? Kingston made haste to conclude
that his actions could not possibly be expected to have
reference to any silly feelings of Gundred’s that might
engender pain in her, as the result of their own incalculable
developments. Perhaps he made himself
too many excuses, defended himself too vehemently,
was in too great haste to declare himself convinced by
his own arguments. He accepted Gundred’s last words
without any symptom of yielding.</p>

<p>And she who, up to the last moment, had never
thought that her big guns could be fired without effect,
was left helpless, defeated, plunged in the bathos of the
situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[351]</span></p>

<p>‘Good-night,’ she said, quietly disguising the black
bruise that her heart had sustained.</p>

<p>Had Kingston suspected it, he might, perhaps, have
softened. But Gundred by now was once more the
cool, self-righteous little faultless person he had always
known. Her serene rectitude of voice and manner
annoyed him.</p>

<p>‘Good-night,’ he answered with equal coolness.
Husband and wife went to their several rooms, after
the first real quarrel of their married life. Innocently,
ignorantly, Ivor Restormel had come between them&mdash;or,
rather, the Thing that lived again in him had stirred
again, as Gundred had divined, to intervene, as once
before, between the two stranger-souls who, in the
flesh, were contented husband and wife.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>


<p>The interloper was established between Kingston and
Gundred, and the purely formal nature of their marriage
might have been clear even to themselves. They fell
apart without wrench or difficulty, and on Gundred a
heavy sense of loneliness settled like a cloud. She it
was that suffered most from the separation, for she
had not her husband’s compensations. All these years
she had lived in the happiness of what she believed to
be perfect intimacy with Kingston, sharing his hopes,
his wishes, his thoughts; now, in a flash, she was made
to guess that she had merely shared the outer aspects
of his life, that the fancied beautiful completeness
of their union was merely the band of tolerance
strengthened through the long years by custom. Now
that the elasticity of the tie that bound them was put
to too great a stretch, it flew asunder, and, in the rebound,<span class="pagenum">[352]</span>
struck Gundred a stinging blow. It was not,
of course, to be expected of her that she should realize
the situation clearly, or face the true state of the case
with any perspicacious candour. All she felt was felt
dimly, instinctively, half-consciously; not even to herself
would she admit what she felt, or analyze the
solitude that seemed gathering round her. But very
vaguely, in the introduction of Ivor Restormel, she
understood that she herself must somehow have failed&mdash;could
not be quite all to her husband that she had
imagined herself, must at some point have fallen short
of the perfect wife’s proper performance. This uncomfortable
perception, which caught her in her
tenderest spot, she made haste to burke and bury in
the depths of her consciousness. But its ghost occasionally
walked; and, though she did the best for herself
by insisting daily on her husband’s unjustifiable
cruelty and the blackness of the influences that had
seduced him, yet she could never wholly escape that
faint instinct of failure which was the one thing that
her efficiency-worshipping nature most passionately
dreaded.</p>

<p>The days went by in a strain that was wholly absurd,
but also wholly unpleasant. Examining things in
the light of healthy, normal experience, Gundred
could not even tell herself that she had a grievance.
She still feared and disliked the presence of Ivor
Restormel, with a fear which no reason could account
for, but which no reason could dispel. But in every
way the boy was perfectly harmless and even pleasant.
Gundred, in her heart of hearts had expected that her
instinct would immediately be justified on closer
acquaintance by discovering that Ivor Restormel took
drugs, or read French novels, or had a tendency to
gambling and kleptomania. She watched him carefully,
in public and in private, secretly and openly,<span class="pagenum">[353]</span>
hoping that some such development might force her
husband to recognise the soundness of her intuitions,
and get rid of the undesirable immigrant. However,
none of these idiosyncrasies could be brought to light,
observe she never so minutely. The boy was just an
ordinary, nice, healthy boy; there was nothing vague
or mysterious or neurotic about him; his personality
had no strong colours anywhere, was altogether mild,
unformed, healthy in its growth. And yet Gundred,
recognising all this, could not help shrinking from him,
shrinking from him more eagerly day by day, with
a vigour of feeling not by any means wholly attributable
to her anger against Kingston for disobeying her wishes
in this matter. Among the weak points of her character
a lack of honesty could not always be counted;
she frankly acknowledged to herself that no fault
could be found with Ivor Restormel. Good, kind,
companionable, nice-minded, he appeared to be everything
that she herself, by all the rules of her code,
should most warmly have liked and approved. This
only made it the odder, therefore, that she should
feel against him so unconquerable a secret dislike.
Gundred almost felt as if it were not the boy himself
that she disliked, but some deep corner of his character
which she seemed to have known and dreaded
for many years. She divined in him a lurking enmity
of which his own innocent and sunny nature was altogether
unconscious. But Gundred pulled herself up
short at this point, and refused to indulge in any such
vain fantasies. People, it is well known, do not contain
these dual personalities; if Gundred dreaded this
boy, who, to all seeming, was everything sane and
wholesome, her feeling could have nothing to do with
any nonsensical superstition, but would certainly&mdash;if
not sooner, then later&mdash;be disastrously shown to have
been founded on fact, by the discovery of its object’s<span class="pagenum">[354]</span>
carefully hidden iniquity. Gundred, as the days went
by, withdrew herself more and more wholly from her
husband’s life. Now she no longer took even a formal
share in it. She stood outside and watched for her
opportunity to strike at the intruder. That neither
Kingston nor Gundred any longer felt how completely
they were removed from each other in itself revealed
the secret weakness which all these years had underlain
the smooth, firm surface of their relations. Each, it
appeared, could do perfectly well without the other,
and only feel the separation as a matter for indignant
pride.</p>

<p>The interloper, meanwhile, was quite unconscious of
the hidden passions that were seething round him.
Ivor Restormel had a happy temperament that only
looked for the best in everything. Reasons and explanations
did not interest him, nor had he much
subtlety to discern any animosity that did not take the
form of a blow in the eye. So long as he was not made
to enter the smoke-haunted rooms of Brakelond he was
inclined simply and wholly to enjoy himself. What
it all meant he had no idea, nor what he had done to
attract so smooth and pleasant a life as seemed to be
opening out before him. Occasionally he had a very
faint suspicion that Lady Gundred, for some reason,
did not entirely approve of him. But, then, she was
always so mild and remote in manner, so it must only
be his fancy; after all, he had done absolutely nothing
to annoy her; and, anyway, what was the good of
bothering? So he took the pleasures that the gods
provided, without question or cavil, and began to enjoy
the surroundings to which he had been so suddenly, so
unexpectedly, transplanted. He had inherited a love
of beauty, comfort, calm; the change from a penurious
life spent between a third-rate Oxford college and a
dingy little house in the Banbury Road, among people<span class="pagenum">[355]</span>
no less distasteful than the lives they led&mdash;the change
from all this to the large serenity of Brakelond was
restful and delicious in the extreme. Here voices were
never raised in queribund tones; here all the little
difficulties of life were kept in oblivion, and existence
went on oiled wheels along a gentle, placid course.
Lady Gundred might be a little chilly and undemonstrative,
but, at any rate, she was always smooth; she
never fussed or grew peevish, was never worried about
the details of housekeeping. Ivor Restormel loved the
unquestioning quiet of his new life. As for his host,
well, there he was altogether baffled.</p>

<p>Mr. Darnley seemed at once indifferent and enthusiastic
about his new secretary. At one moment he
would talk eagerly, almost affectionately; and then,
again, he would be perfectly indefinite and tame in
tone. Ivor could not make it out at all; did Mr.
Darnley like him or not? Surely he must&mdash;surely
he must even have taken a strange, violent fancy to
him. Otherwise, why should Mr. Darnley have made
such rapid advances; why should he have been so
anxious to get him over to Brakelond; why should he
have been in such haste to offer him the secretaryship,
and so keen that he should take it? All these
things were proof of liking, if anything in the world
could ever be. Yet Ivor Restormel could never feel
wholly satisfied, after all, that his host had any personal
feeling for him. In himself he even seemed to
bore Mr. Darnley. Ivor was quite acute enough to
see before long that Mr. Darnley took very little interest
in him personally. And this made the whole relation
incalculably strange. Why saddle yourself, why go out
of your way to saddle yourself with a person for whom
you do not intrinsically care two straws? Ivor began
to think that he even noticed a certain animosity sometimes
in his host’s attitude towards him. It almost<span class="pagenum">[356]</span>
seemed as if by talking in his own person, of his own
concerns, that he was annoying and disappointing
Mr. Darnley. What could this mean? Mr. Darnley
appeared to be always watching him, always listening
for some chance word from him. And then, all of a
sudden, Mr. Darnley’s interest would kindle and
flame. Warmth would come into his manner, and
Ivor would get the sensation of being acutely liked.
And then, in a moment, perhaps, his talk would
wander outside the range of its listener’s interest.
Mr. Darnley would shake his head with a sort of
desperate irritation, the light would die out of his eyes,
and his demeanour become cold, and sometimes even
savage. Evidently the talker must have somehow
cheated him, must have ceased to say the things he
wished to hear. But what were those things? Ivor
Restormel spurred himself to unaccustomed subtlety;
he disliked this sensation of being, as it were, only spasmodically
and vicariously cultivated. His face and
manners generally made him friends without difficulty;
he was piqued by their apparent failure to give him any
victory over a man whom they had seemed to lead so
unresistingly captive at first sight.</p>

<p>Ivor exerted himself to ensure Mr. Darnley’s approval,
and carefully marked the moments which held
his employer’s enthusiasm and the subjects that provoked
it. Apparently, though, any talk of his own
life and ideas was of no interest, or very little, to Mr.
Darnley. And how can one capture people’s friendship
if they are obviously bored by everything that
concerns one’s self? No; not quite everything. Ivor
soon found that any talk about his particular private
weaknesses was always sure to rouse Mr. Darnley to a
subdued, secret fury of eagerness. As soon as Ivor
dropped any chance apologetic word about the terrors
that he had so strangely inherited, and as long as he<span class="pagenum">[357]</span>
continued telling of them, so long, and so long only,
did Mr. Darnley seem to have an interest and a liking
for him&mdash;an interest wonderfully keen, a liking deep
and strong. And then, if he took advantage of this
evident friendship to go on to other matters, then the
evident friendship would immediately chill off and
vanish into an annoyed indifference. Mr. Darnley
could not be touched by conversation on any other
topic. But that one topic was always sure of the most
instant success; it had only to hint its presence in the
dialogue for Mr. Darnley’s whole zeal to leap to the
alert. Mr. Darnley even seemed to be always watching
for its appearance, and, what was strange and even
exasperating, would put up with hours of Ivor’s conversation
in the obvious hope that sooner or later
the one matter of interest would crop up into the talk.
It is annoying to find one’s company cherished only
for the sake of conversation on one particular subject,
and Ivor began deliberately to avoid the topic, as much
from hurt vanity as from personal pride.</p>

<p>Then the situation developed even more oddly, for
Mr. Darnley would hardly let the boy out of his sight.
He must be always at his side, always putting up with
what clearly failed to interest him, in the persistent
hope that as the delay grew longer and more wearisome,
so the reappearance of the one interesting topic must
be coming nearer and growing surer. He clung to
Ivor’s company, although it plainly had no intrinsic
value for him, anxious not to lose a moment of it, for
fear the moment of true speech should come and pass
without his knowledge. Ivor, sweet-natured as he
was, showed his resentment at the topsy-turvy situation
by talking persistently of things that concerned
himself, his daily life, or his employer’s. And it was
even amusing, had it not been rather humiliating, to
notice how Mr. Darnley chafed beneath the interminable<span class="pagenum">[358]</span>
ordeal, yet would not lose an instant of it, lest in
that instant the thing he was looking for so passionately
should poke its head up and vanish again unnoticed.
But Ivor, for sheer pride, would indulge him
but seldom. Besides, it happened that the one thing
which Kingston wished to hear was also, naturally
enough, the one thing that Ivor least wished to tell.
For the boy was acutely ashamed of those idiotic instincts
of terror with which his premature birth had
left him. The one thing worse than those terrors themselves
was the humiliation of acknowledging them.
So he was doubly reluctant to gratify the morbid
curiosity of the older man.</p>

<p>Kingston, in fact, was paying very heavily for the
indulgence of his long desire. The situation, to him,
was one persistent agony of expectation, always
straining, always being disappointed. Now at last he
understood the punishment that he had earned. For,
by his own wish, he was doomed to call, and call for
ever, to something that could never hear. The dead
was free, but the living was still bound, was more
tightly bound than ever in that bond of desire which
is at once the pet pleasure and the dreadful agony of
all who enter it. And a dreary agony it was; Isabel
was there, within his reach almost, but for ever beyond
his reach. No cry could rouse her, no appeal restore
her personality to life. And yet, mysteriously but
certainly, she was there once more; once more clothed
in flesh, once more gazing out of human eyes and
speaking with a human voice. Nevertheless, for all
the good he could have of his prayer’s gratification, she
might still have been dead bones and dust of the earth.
For she could not hear him, could not recognise him,
and the irony of her deaf, blind presence at his side
was a torment far more keen than all the long years of
her absence. He ravened and battered against the<span class="pagenum">[359]</span>
iron wall of her unconsciousness, and for ever was
beaten back, sickened, bruised and bleeding from the
violence&mdash;the eternally fruitless violence&mdash;of his effort
to stir her recollection. Her memory slept for ever in
the dead past; only the immortal part of her still
lived, and was incurably deaf to any human call. She
did not hear him, she could not hear him; never, never,
all down the ages could she hear him again. The
irremediable separation was only made more ghastly,
more appalling, by the tantalizing proximity of her.
He could see her, hear her, know her well. And all the
knowledge was not only profitless, but an aggravation
of his misery. He saw now what a fool he had been to
tie himself anew in the bondage of desire; an eternal
parting would have been far less painful, far less
maddeningly cruel, than this grim and nugatory
reunion.</p>

<p>Again and again he battled fiercely to win the recognition
that he knew in his heart of hearts to be for ever
beyond his reach. He was incessantly trying to lead Ivor
Restormel into some discussion of his secret terrors,
hoping that so Isabel’s voice might speak once more,
and possibly, in time, Isabel’s self be aroused again.
But the task was hard, and Ivor reluctant to be made
the mouthpiece of that inmost self of his whose identity&mdash;whose
very existence, even&mdash;he never suspected.
And then it was that Kingston found himself hating
the boy. The boy stood between himself and Isabel;
for ever must stand between himself and Isabel. And
yet the boy contained the secret treasure&mdash;<em>was</em>, in a
worldly sense, the secret treasure; he could not have
the one for a neighbour without putting up with the
presence of the other, without keeping the boy for
ever at his side, and tolerating endlessly the revelations
of the boy’s uninteresting personality. Kingston
approved of the young fellow well enough in himself;<span class="pagenum">[360]</span>
he was amiable, kind, pleasant to look at and talk to.
In ordinary circumstances Kingston would have liked
him and never thought twice about him. Now, however,
his liking was complicated by a resentment that
at times deepened into something like hate. The
boy was keeping so much from him. It was not the
boy’s fault, of course, yet that did not make the
situation any easier to bear. He alternately liked
and disliked him with a vigour for which the boy’s own
personality was entirely innocent.</p>

<p>He was always laying traps for him, watching him,
trying to stir up the spirit that possessed him. Gladly
would Kingston have pierced between Ivor and the
secret thing that inhabited him. The one he valued
not at all, or only as containing the other which he
now valued above everything in the world, for ever
beyond his reach though it was. He resented the boy’s
body, his beauty, his young developing nature which,
sooner or later, might be expected to conquer those old
dim memories and achieve the ultimate death of the
Isabel he had known those twenty years before. If
he could have set free the sleeping soul he would
gladly have seen its new body break up and die. He
hated that new body, which made so impermeable a
wall between himself and the vanished thing he had so
vainly found again. He looked on Ivor Restormel as
an unarmed burglar might look on an impregnable safe
in which lies the diamond of his ambition. The safe
is precious and desirable because of the diamond inside,
but, in so far as it makes the diamond impregnable,
is doubly detestable for the very fact that the
diamond <em>is</em> inside. And in Kingston’s case the
problem was even crueller; for the burglar may, with
long labour, break the safe and attain the diamond.
Kingston, in breaking the safe, would by the same
action cause the diamond to vanish once more. As<span class="pagenum">[361]</span>
things stood, the safety&mdash;at all events, the continued
proximity&mdash;of the diamond depended entirely on
the continued security and inviolate condition of
the safe.</p>

<p>He began soon, in his difficulty, to read up the
countless Oriental cases of prenatal memory. There,
in the East, souls that have been parted by bodily
death are reunited in another shape, and know each
other and are happy. There the great facts of life,
of that shadowy fallacy that we call death, are clearly
known and understood. But here we are still driven
by phantom fears, and troubled by that which has no
real existence except in our own weakened imaginations.
Our memories are too closely trammelled by
false teaching, too little practised and experienced, to
pass intact across the blank interval of physical death.
At the best it is only an occasional glimpse we carry
on into another life, and even so those glimpses come
but rarely, and fade as our earthly life advances to
maturity again. More people have these glimpses, it
is true, than ever dare to acknowledge them; but they
are little understood and never fairly made use of.
It is to the East we must go to see how little account
the trained soul makes of physical death. There,
through innumerable ages, the light has been seen,
and memory has been educated from hour to hour
and from day to day until at last the soul finds it as
easy to recall the events of a hundred years ago as
those of last night or this morning. Kingston studied
the many cases that the Eastern Gospel gives us, and
which Western science is just beginning to discern
anew. Always he hoped against hope that they
would give him some key to unlock the house of
memory. Yes, the mortal body is just that&mdash;a house
of memory, a jerry-built house at best. But the lock
is stern and stark. What key is there, what jemmy,<span class="pagenum">[362]</span>
what crowbar, that can prevail on the lock that guards
the house of memories, can prevail, at least, without
wrecking the house and letting the memories go free
once more?</p>

<p>Kingston had no hope that he could find such a key.
The old Eastern stories showed the glorified free
memory as the possession only of the free glorified
soul that has escaped the bondage of desire. When
desire has passed away, then the uncontaminated soul
knows no barrier of time or space. But in the kingdom
of desire are all the burning pains and limitations
which desire provides to scourge its devotees in the
very moment of their seeming satisfaction. To eyes
desirous, life is narrowed to a thing of the moment; it
is only from the high places of enlightenment that the
opened eye of the Real Self can wander over all the
fields of existence, and see the nullity of death, the
eternity of truth and holiness, from bodily life to
bodily life, until at last the great goal is gained. Kingston
saw himself helpless now in the grip of the passion
he had invoked. Nothing could satisfy it, nothing
could release him from it. Nothing but the death of
his body, and even that release seemed now to his
awakening intelligence to be but problematical. He
began to wonder what could be the end of this fantastic
tangle. Days went by, and he found himself
more tightly chained to the agony of his perpetual
disappointment in Ivor Restormel, more cruelly
hungry for the satisfaction which lay for ever in his
sight and beyond his reach, more and more fiercely
stung by the misery that he himself had brought upon
himself.</p>

<p>He grew into a sense of drifting towards a catastrophe;
the strain, the torment could not be prolonged
indefinitely without the sudden snap of his endurance.
Some thunderclap of fate must break up the dreadful<span class="pagenum">[363]</span>
stagnation of this nightmare. As the time passed, and
his efforts brought him no nearer to fulfilment, made
it increasingly plain that he could never come any
nearer to fulfilment, he felt the growing imminence of
doom. This companion who was no companion, his
desire had evoked It from the shadows, soon It must
go back into the shadows from which he had called It,
having first accomplished fully the punishment of his
selfishness. He watched the human Ivor Restormel
with a curious consciousness of watching a thing unearthly,
a thing moving amid darkness towards a great
darkness not so very far away. This boy, so much
alive, so content with life, was not in reality alive at
all. He was just a shadow, a faint film of personality,
by comparison with the old living thing that lurked
in him. Vague and indeterminate as his own character
was, he was the penalty, made incarnate, of
Kingston’s own selfishness; he was the eidolon of the
past projected into the present in order to tantalize
and damn the soul that had desired it. Built of
clouds, he must pass back ere long, swiftly, tragically
into cloudland, and that reality behind the clouds, that
living fragment far down in the shadowy personality
of the boy, must pass onwards again on its upward
way&mdash;that strange immortal essence which once had
been Isabel. And this foreknowledge of the end, this
sensation of drifting daily more and more hurriedly
towards something terrible, impelled him to cherish
with a more and more eager passion this presence that
had been vouchsafed to him, however incomplete,
however unsatisfying he might find it.</p>

<p>Each hour brought him nearer now to the last that
should ever be. He bent himself sternly, in the lessening
time that was his, to the desperate task of
awakening recollection in a soul where recollection
slept for ever. Less and less did he see or think of<span class="pagenum">[364]</span>
Ivor Restormel, more and more ardently, more and
more despairingly, of the thing that dwelt in Ivor
Restormel, the thing that soon must leave its habitation
to pass elsewhere again. He sought the boy’s
presence more and more persistently, would never
spare him out of his sight, exacted more and more
of his conversation. And all the while he was caring
less and less for the boy, his words, or his utterance.
Now that he had found out what it was that had
attracted him to the boy, he was ceasing to see the
boy himself at all, to hear his earthly voice. All
Kingston’s attention was fixed on the glimpses that
he could hope to get of the secret presence he divined,
his ears were open only to those occasional flashes of
memory that spoke in Ivor Restormel out of that
remote past beyond the grave. He must make the
dreadful most of the short time that was left him.
It was but little he could hope to make, but the time,
he felt, was running rapidly out towards its end.</p>

<p>Gundred saw everything. Gundred understood
nothing. That her husband grew keener and keener
to monopolize Ivor Restormel she saw, and righteous
anger became fiercer within her. That Kingston
should so slight her company as obviously and
vehemently to prefer that of a person against whom
she had most solemnly warned him, was matter enough
and to spare for just wrath. Gundred grew colder
and colder in manner, lived more and more aloof,
felt stronger and stronger in her consciousness of
justified dread. That Kingston clung every moment
to the side of his secretary she noticed; that, in
reality, he did not care two straws about his secretary
she could hardly be expected to discern. The
plain and sufficing fact was that he never seemed
happy, never at his ease, unless Ivor Restormel were
with him, and even then he very rarely seemed perfectly<span class="pagenum">[365]</span>
satisfied either. Gundred saw that there was
something unusual and mysterious about this friendship
that in some ways scarcely seemed a friendship
at all, yet made such tremendous claims on time and
company.</p>

<p>Gundred, scanning the situation from her retirement,
came deliberately to the conclusion that Kingston’s
evident infatuation was the result of some malign influence.
Nothing else could account for his restless
attraction towards Ivor Restormel, combined so frequently
with obvious boredom and annoyance when
in his company; nothing could so completely explain
the apparent innocuousness of Ivor himself, as compared
with the instinct of repulsion that Gundred
always felt towards him, and felt more fanatically from
day to day. Gundred knew that she was not capable
of unjust or disorderly feelings. And, if she disliked
people, it meant that they deserved to be disliked.
And if no reason for such a dislike could be discovered
anywhere in Ivor Restormel’s personality, well, that
only made it more clear that Gundred’s infallible
instinct was founded on her perception in him of some
evil supernatural influence, possessing him and working
through him. The idea grew and fermented in her
brain, and heroic remedies began to suggest themselves.
No one, in these dreadful latter days, could
seriously doubt that the Evil One was abroad. What
more credible than that he should have picked out for
attack a soul like her husband’s, which Gundred knew
to be weak in doctrine, and saw to be not impeccable
in practice? Gundred grew in the certainty that,
whether Ivor Restormel knew it or no, he was filled
with unhallowed powers that were exerting a wicked
force on the man whom he had so uncannily attracted
from the first.</p>

<p>All her life’s course had led Gundred along placid,<span class="pagenum">[366]</span>
sunny ways, and her nature, through those years, had
revealed only the peace and serenity of true refinement.
And now, at last, at the touch of this righteous
jealousy, there began to stir in her the fierce old blood
of Queen Isabel, the stern harsh passions of the Mortimers.
The fanatic stirred in its long sleep, and
Gundred felt herself inspired to lead a domestic crusade
against the Powers of Darkness. At any cost her husband
must be saved. In old days an Earl of March
had, by his laudable zeal in persecution, elicited commendatory
letters from Queen Mary. His spirit now
awoke in Gundred, and she realized in herself the
strength to act mightily in a noble cause.</p>

<p>In every way this undesirable intruder, who seemed
so amiable and pleasant and desirable, was having the
most untoward effect on Kingston’s mind and morals.
Had he not caused a hitherto blameless and obedient
husband to revolt against his wife’s righteous dominion
after twenty years of harmony, and to cast her wishes
defiantly beneath his feet? And now it became
obvious that Kingston was suffering in other ways.
She saw him to be a dabbler in things best left
alone, in things unhallowed, Satanic, dreadful. Of his
attendance on spirit-circles Gundred luckily knew
nothing, otherwise, in her determination to be old-fashioned
by contrast with the hysterical occultism
that now obtains, she would probably have wished to
call in an exorcist. But even in his reading he had
strayed into improper paths. The strangest things he
was now for ever studying&mdash;Eastern books and mystical
fantasies of the most unsettling description. The
weirdest of these he made a point of reading to Ivor
Restormel, and Gundred, who generally insisted on
being by, noticed that he seemed to read eagerly,
challengingly, as if in momentary expectation that
the matter would elicit some answering flash of some<span class="pagenum">[367]</span>
kind or another from the boy. It never did, and the
readings, therefore, always broke off short with a
shrug of disappointment and even of disgust; but
Gundred divined a soul in peril from the very attempt
he made. It was surely an incantation he was practising,
an invocation to the mysterious evil thing that
haunted Ivor Restormel. She presented a bold front
to such dangers, and would not be kept away from the
readings.</p>

<p>Kingston one Sunday evening seemed absorbed in
his dubious books, while Gundred sat at her knitting,
an employment by which she piously signalized the
Sabbath. All through the week she did fine needlework,
but on Sunday she put away her embroideries
and conscientiously knitted comforters for the Deep-sea
Fishermen. But suddenly Kingston looked up from
his page, and began to read in a curious tone of watchful
defiance, addressing his secretary, who was inoffensively
engaged with a newspaper. ‘Listen to
this, Ivor,’ he began, ‘listen to this, and tell me what
you think of it.’ Gundred, in her observant silence,
noted that her opinion was not asked, and her wrath
grew greater and more righteous, chalking up yet
another item to the Evil One’s account. ‘“Once upon
a time,”’ read Kingston, ‘“many thousands of years
ago, there came a great Buddha to a city in India. He
was a great and glorious Buddha, but the time is so
very far away now that even his name has passed into
Nirvana, and cannot be recalled. But all the people
in the city wrought their hardest to do him honour.
From the King and his nobles downward everyone
gave his richest silks and rugs to line the road of the
Holy One’s arrival, and in all their land there was not
a widow or a little child so poor that they had not some
bright pebble or piece of cloth to do their small homage
to the Incarnate Perfection. Only one shepherd lad,<span class="pagenum">[368]</span>
from the jungle beyond, had nothing to give. He was
young and strong and very beautiful, and his whole
soul cried out in worship of the Buddha. The most
splendid jewel in the world, the most priceless tapestry
and cloth of gold, he would not have thought good
enough for the honouring of the Holy One; and yet
he had nothing, no treasure, however humble, that he
could throw beneath the blessed feet. He, that would
have given half the world, had not so much as a
handful of painted shells. So his heart was very heavy
within him, and sadly did he draw near to the city on
the appointed day. And on his road there met him a
maiden, lovely and gracious, that wore in her hair a
flower. But this was such a flower as the boy had
never seen before. It was altogether radiant and
heavenly, splendid beyond the imagination of man to
conceive. It grew in a cluster of seven blooms, and
the fragrance of it filled the jungle. If he could only
have this wonderful thing to offer to the Heavenly
Visitor, then, indeed, thought the boy, he would at
least have done no dishonour to the Light that his
heart honoured above all else on earth. ‘Maiden,’
he said, ‘for what price will you sell me the flower that
you wear in your hair?’ And she answered that for a
very great price she would sell him two blossoms
from the cluster. And once again his heart was
daunted, for the price she asked was more than anything
that he could hope to get together in a long
laborious life. He shook his head. ‘I had desired,’
he replied, ‘to do fitting honour to the Holy One,
but I see now that that hope is beyond me.’ Then
the maiden took the blossom from her hair and held
it out towards him, for her eyes were opened. ‘My
Lord,’ she answered to the peasant lad, ‘my sight is
unsealed, and I can see. Very many years hence&mdash;a
thousand years hence&mdash;I see that you, in the fullness of<span class="pagenum">[369]</span>
time, even you yourself shall become a revealed
Buddha here on earth. Take this flower of mine,
then, without money and without price, but promise
me only that in that far day I may stand at your
right hand and be near you in your glory.’ And the
boy smiled and gave her his word. So after all he
had his offering to lay before the Blessed One, and his
heart was satisfied. And the maiden went her way
through life, and on through the many deaths that lay
beyond. And he also, the peasant lad, died in the
ripeness of his age, and lived and died through many
generations, advancing always on the upward road.
And at length the time was accomplished, and the
maiden’s prophecy fulfilled. For the peasant lad
became the Spotless One, the Buddha Sakhya-Muni,
High and Holy, altogether Blessed and Perfect, the
Best Friend of All the World. And in that day,
the maiden found herself again, and came at last to
her reward. For she was the Lady Yasodhara, his
wife, the first of all the sacred women that trod the
happy way and entered into light....”’</p>

<p>Kingston ceased, his voice filled with interrogation,
pausing eagerly for Ivor’s opinion, hoping against hope
that that opinion might be more illuminating than he
felt it would be. Again and again had he tried to
kindle that dormant consciousness with scenes like
this, always keenly hoping that they would touch
some chord of understanding far down in the hidden
depths of the boy’s dual personality. But the hope
was never to be fulfilled; he knew it was never to be
fulfilled, yet each fresh disappointment was sharper
and more wounding than the last. Kingston paused
for a comment on the story. None came. After a
pause he demanded one.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ he said, ‘what did you think of that, Ivor?’</p>

<p>The boy looked up; his attention, though formally<span class="pagenum">[370]</span>
yielded to Kingston’s reading, had, in reality, been
surreptitiously concentrated on the sporting column
of the paper he held in his hand.</p>

<p>‘What did I think of it?’ he repeated a trifle
vaguely. ‘Oh, not half bad. Quite a decent bit of
writing. But awful rot, sir, of course.’</p>

<p>Kingston vibrated with acute annoyance. Thus,
for the thousandth time, the gate of possibilities had
been slammed brutally in his face by the uninteresting
shadowy, rudimentary soul that shared Ivor Restormel’s
body with that wonderful immortal dead. He
gazed at the boy with positive hatred in his eyes.
In a spasm of irritation Kingston turned towards his
wife.</p>

<p>‘And you, Gundred,’ he inquired, ‘what do you
think of it? Evidently Ivor hasn’t the faintest notion
what it is all about. It says nothing to him. Does
it say anything to you?’</p>

<p>‘Very dreadful and unchristian,’ said Gundred
firmly, but mildly. ‘I wonder you can bear to read
such things. I am sure it cannot be good for Mr.
Restormel to hear them.’</p>

<p>Kingston might talk if he pleased of ‘Ivor,’ Gundred
pointed her disapproval by adhering rigidly to the
formal mode of address, and would never accord her
enemy the favour of any more friendly appellation.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Restormel,’ she repeated decisively, ‘could
not be expected to see anything in such irreverent
nonsense.’</p>

<p>Kingston could not trust himself to answer her, nor
to make any further remark on the abysmal stupidity
of the boy who stood so perpetually between him and
the memory of Isabel. Hurriedly turning over the
pages, he began to read that most wonderful scene in
history, the second meeting of the triumphant Buddha
with Yasodhara his wife, after those many years of<span class="pagenum">[371]</span>
parting and glorification. Both the world’s great
Buddha stories contain the tragedy of a woman;
but the tale of the Indian Princess, widowed through
long earthly years of the man she loved, and then, in
the end, reunited with the Perfected Incarnation of
Holiness, is even more tremendous, if less physically
poignant, than that of the Mother who stood on
Calvary. Mystical, majestic, splendid, is the crowning
moment in the life of Yasodhara, and Kingston read
the words that relate it with a passionate sense of the
truth that they convey. Then he fell silent.</p>

<p>‘Very pretty, dear,’ said Gundred. ‘Would you
pick up my wool for me? Thanks. But I do think
one might find something more profitable to read on
Sundays. I think one ought to make Sunday different
somehow, from other days, and not read novels and
things like that. One should only read <em>real</em> things
on Sundays&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>She slipped into sight the volume with which she
occasionally beguiled the devout labours of her knitting.
With a gentle little air of excellence she laid it down
again unostentatiously, but so that the gilt lettering
showed along its cover. It was the ‘Life of Bishop
Boffatt,’ by Three Nieces, with a ‘Foreword’ from
Archdeacon Widge.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>


<p>All this clearly indicated that Gundred’s interference
was urgently needed in the cause of holiness.
Day by day she watched the situation, feeling more
and more certain that her mission was the rescue of
her husband. He, meanwhile, bore hourly, with
increasing pain, the tantalizing torments of his paradoxical
proximity to the thing he had so long looked for<span class="pagenum">[372]</span>
and now had found in vain. Ivor Restormel wondered
at his good fortune, and only occasionally noticed the
crochets of Kingston and Gundred. Of the two,
Gundred had by far the more tactful temperament.
Her dislike, now fast verging towards religious horror,
was not to be discerned except by an eye far more keen
than Ivor Restormel’s. A serene gravity, a cool
calm were so much the dominant characteristics of
her nature that the exaggeration of her gravity, the
additional chill in her calm passed unnoticed by one
so little practised in observation. The restless eagerness
of Kingston was more plain and more distressing.
Ivor Restormel sometimes wondered what it was
that he did or failed to do that so roused disappointment
and annoyance in this friend who never really
seemed a friend, and yet had gratuitously done so much
for him. However, he was not of a temper to let such
matters oppress him. He put them behind him, and
disregarded any tension that he might ever be inclined
to discern in his relations with his employer or his
employer’s wife.</p>

<p>So the days passed unsatisfactorily by, until the time
came for the family’s removal to Ivescar. Deep in his
heart Kingston had a dim hope that the sight of
Ivescar might once more rekindle a flash of memory in
the boy. It was with trembling anxiety that he
watched the first impressions that Ivor received from
his first sight of the Yorkshire moors. Would the veil
lift again, for even the briefest glance from the soul
that dwelt behind? Brakelond had roused the sleeping
personality in the boy; surely it was only to be
expected that Ivescar, where so much had happened,
could do no less? And Ivor gratified Kingston’s hope
up to a certain point&mdash;only, as before, in doing so to
rouse a keener desire. For from the first sight he
instinctively loved the mountain-country, entered into<span class="pagenum">[373]</span>
its charm, appreciated the solemn majesty of it. He
felt, he said, as if he had known it all his life, as if he
and the hills were friends of long standing. And
Kingston, hearing this, listened with quiet face but
with a heart agonized in suspense. The door seemed
to be drawing ajar for a greater revelation. The very
next moment might bring some recognition. Kingston
would not admit to himself the hopelessness of his
hope. Eagerly he waited for what the boy might say
next. And the door opened no further, but closed
again as fast as ever. Never again could that hidden
consciousness of Ivor’s wake to know itself. The
expectation that it ever would was groundless, tormenting,
delusive as all the pleasures held out by false
desire. Kingston suffered more than ever, as each fresh
disappointment grew more painful than the last, though
more and more surely anticipated. The boy knew
nothing; no veil could be lifted from his eyes; he
enjoyed his surroundings simply, boyishly, without
any sense of deep memories out of which they were
built.</p>

<p>And then, into the midst of these unhappy combinations
was precipitated the new element of Jim Darnley’s
presence. Jim Darnley at fifteen was unfeignedly glad
to find a companion not so very much ahead of him in
years. Ivor Restormel was young for his age; Jim
Darnley, as an only son, was inclined to be older than
his; and the instant fellowship that was established
between the two set the last seal on Gundred’s righteous
indignation. Kingston did not care whom or what the
earthly Ivor Restormel might care for, so long as his
company might still hold out hopes of glimpses from
the past. Moreover, he was glad that Jim should
have a companion, and should, by taking so comfortable
a fancy to him, justify his father in the choice of
a secretary. As a man, and as a man already preoccupied<span class="pagenum">[374]</span>
with other matters, he had no sort of inclination
to be jealous of his son’s friendships. With Gundred,
however, the case was altogether different. She
loved her only child with the fierce and almost savage
affection often felt by a woman who cannot understand
the object of that affection. Naturally the fact was
the last thing that she would allow her soul to face,
but in the jealousy with which she regarded all new
factors in his life might be read her unacknowledged
fear that her intimacy with him might not be as strong
as she made a point of believing it to be. She was one
of those women who are by nature more mother than
wife, and in the fullness of uneventful years had insensibly
come to transfer a good deal of her old urgent
passion for Kingston to the child that she had borne
him. In connection with Gundred, mild and cool,
ferocity and passion are words that sound oddly, and
yet, under the suave mildness, the dispassionate
decorum of her manner, her feelings for her son had a
certain definite passion, and even ferocity. That the
boy never knew it was the misfortune of his mother’s
training; she would not betray the fact of her love, and
had no thought that by so betraying it she might be
able to supplement, in his eyes, the deficiencies of her
understanding.</p>

<p>For Gundred was incapable of any true companionship
with her son. He admired her, he loved her distantly
and diffidently, but he shrank from her, and had
nothing intimate or warm to say. That she was not
conscious of this flaw in their relation may be called
the compensating mercy of that weakness in herself
which had developed that flaw. She was by now
almost entirely devoid of intuitive intelligence. Or,
rather, perhaps, she had so diligently trained herself
that, in the long course of time, she had drilled her mind
out of any faint tendency to perceive and analyze that<span class="pagenum">[375]</span>
it may ever have possessed. Her sense of decency
commanded her to live entirely on the surface of
things; prying into secret motives and feelings she
considered vulgar and indecent. Accordingly, if lip-kisses
were properly exchanged, and superficial affection
reigned, she made a point of considering that the
soul-relations thus symbolized must be eminently
satisfactory. She looked no further than the symbol,
and disliked the idea that kisses and terms of endearment
may, after all, not stand for the love whose
emblems they are&mdash;may even, at a pinch, be used to
disguise the lack of that love. And yet her hidden,
shamefaced jealousy may be taken to have been the
last flickering phantom of the natural woman’s insight
into domestic relations. All his life she had
grudged her son his friendships, gently nipped them
with the frost of her criticism, sedulously taught him
to find fault and be captious.</p>

<p>The education had borne no fruit in Jim, except a
bitter one for Gundred. His nature was too warm and
sunny to have any real communion with his mother’s
frosts, and as soon as he found that she always had
something coldly unpleasant to say of everyone he
liked, he had responded, not by discarding his friends,
but by drawing farther and farther away from his
mother. With the merciless clear-sightedness of the
young, so vivid, if so limited, he had judged his mother
by her own precepts long since, and found her wanting.
She endlessly preached the loveliest morality, the
tenderest forbearance towards all the world, the most
sedulous avoidance of harsh or censorious comment.
And yet she was always sure to pick some fatal flaw in
all his friends, to discover and expose some blemish,
to insist on some fault or weakness. And the very
fact that her criticisms were always more or less just
militated, in the end, against her influence. For Jim<span class="pagenum">[376]</span>
found that he liked his friends more than he disliked
their failings, and, taking their side accordingly, he
gradually came to look upon his mother’s unerring eye
for other people’s shortcomings as the worst enemy of
his own happiness. Thus pitiably, by the exaggeration
of her own virtues, through the keenness of her
own maternal love, Gundred laid up for herself inevitable
disappointment in regard to the one thing that her
heart desired, and innocently prepared for herself a
dark version of the mother’s tragedy. By now Jim
had his friends and his life to himself; outside that
precinct, walled and guarded, stood his mother,
alone, too proud to admit that she stood outside,
too wilfully blind to see the unbroken wall that
fronted her, and, in any case, too proud to clamour
for admittance.</p>

<p>But the friendship that immediately arose between
Jim and Ivor Restormel was to Gundred as a sudden
light of revelation, laying bare the fact of her exclusion
from her son’s life. Characteristically, even to herself,
she would not admit what she saw, but attributed the
novel pain to her anxiety for Jim’s welfare. That
Jim should have friends of his own age had been
grudgingly conceded as an odious necessity, to be
cavilled at and snubbed, but impossible to deny. Now,
however, that the pernicious influence that had so
mysteriously gripped her husband threatened to
enthral her son as well, Gundred told herself that all
her maternal duties, no less than her conjugal, commanded
her to take the field against the powers of
darkness. Her jealousy masqueraded as pure motherly
zeal, and its very bitterness was masked from her own
sight by the disguise of duty. Her feeling, too, was
intensified by the failure of all her usual weapons to
discredit Ivor Restormel in the eyes of his new friend.
Jim generally sat and answered her in submissive<span class="pagenum">[377]</span>
affirmatives, while she gently dissected his friends and
pointed out how entirely unworthy they all were of
approval, though not, of course, of pity; now, however,
he could not even give her criticism the courtesy of
apparent acquiescence.</p>

<p>He rose up in defence of Ivor, instead of, as usual,
listening pleasantly and then going his own way undeterred&mdash;a
course which long experience had taught
him was the wisest, especially as his mother was quite
unable to notice that her advice was disregarded, if
only her advice had been politely received. In vain
she pointed out to him that Ivor Restormel’s mind
was cheap and crude; that his orthodoxy was tepid,
his manners unnecessarily enthusiastic, his whole deportment
lacking in finish and refinement. Jim could
not listen in respectful silence; he protested, he pleaded.
He had become all of a sudden disloyal and treacherous
to his mother. Gundred regarded all opposition from
her son as unfilial, and could not conceive the possibility
of his having any right to hold an opinion at
variance with hers. She claimed to provide him with
all his thoughts, henceforth and for ever, on the ground
of having in the distant past provided him with a body
to hold them. That her son was an individual she
could never recognise, and on the rare occasions of his
overt revolt, felt the indignant astonishment of Balaam
when he discovered that his ass had a voice of its own.
Accordingly, if Jim now opposed her criticisms, it was
only a treason and a sin engendered in him by this evil
spirit that had captured him, and every word that he
said in Ivor’s favour only served to deepen his mother’s
feeling that she was certainly called upon to rid her
son and her husband of this threatening danger that
had already produced such dire results in the disaffection
of her nearest and dearest.</p>

<p>‘I cannot have you running about the hills all day<span class="pagenum">[378]</span>
with Mr. Restormel, dear,’ said Gundred blandly, but
with decision.</p>

<p>‘But why not, mother?’ protested Jim, who, in
normal circumstances would probably have said, ‘No,
mother,’ and gone all the same, Gundred never
knowing.</p>

<p>‘Because I say not, dear,’ replied Gundred inadequately.
‘You must let mother be the best judge of
your companions, dear. Mother knows best&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>‘I say, you know, I think it is awfully hard lines.
Ivor is the best fellow going. You don’t know him,
mother.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t call him Ivor, Jim,’ reproved Gundred. ‘It
is not respectful. He is older than you. And that is
another reason why I do not like to see you wasting
your time with him. He is not good company for
you.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but you always say that. What is there
wrong with poor old Ivor?’</p>

<p>Having nothing definite to allege, Gundred, of
course, found it necessary to become sibylline and
pompous.</p>

<p>‘You must trust mother, dear,’ she answered.
‘There are many things you are too young to know.
It is enough for you to remember that mother does not
wish you to see too much of Mr. Restormel. You
must avoid him as much as possible&mdash;though, of
course, without being rude and unkind.’</p>

<p>But Gundred’s solemn implication of mysterious
knowledge had been played off so frequently that it
had long since lost its effect. Jim knew well that it
only concealed her invariable jealousy.</p>

<p>‘No,’ he said; ‘I am awfully fond of old Ivor. I
don’t see why I should make myself nasty to him.
Father likes him no end.’</p>

<p>This did not serve to mollify Gundred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[379]</span></p>

<p>‘You should always do what mother wishes, without
asking questions,’ she rejoined. ‘And what father
may do is no concern of yours. Your father may be
taken in like everybody else. But you ought to
think it a privilege to obey your mother. Think of
what you owe her&mdash;yes?’</p>

<p>Like many women, Gundred believed that, having
engendered a child, entirely without regard for that
problematical child’s wishes, must necessarily give her
a lifelong claim on his gratitude. Like many women,
she insisted on the debt, everywhere and always, until,
by ceaseless demands, she had come near to exhausting
the supply. Accordingly the conference continued for
a while, unsatisfactorily. Jim for once had lost his
grip on that lamentable diplomacy which an unwise
mother’s exactions so early engrain into her children.
He could no longer even acquiesce. He became warm
in Ivor’s defence, and, with every word, Gundred felt
more certainly that his disloyalty was the crime of
the evil force that possessed him. That force must unquestionably
be combated and dispossessed. And soon
she found that she was incapable of coping with Jim.
Worse, she could not even have recourse to the secular
arm in the person of her husband, for her husband was
equally under this incalculable diabolical sway. She
grew more angry in her demands as the demands were
refused. And Jim, flushed with opposition, verged on
rudeness, would not be brought to promise the abandonment
of his new friend, and treated his mother’s
ultimatum with ominous cheerfulness.</p>

<p>‘You would not like to have to choose between Mr.
Restormel and mother, would you&mdash;no?’ suggested
Gundred with the supreme imprudence of excitement.
And this weapon, too, had lost its efficacy with too frequent
use. Jim had heard it too often now to retain
any illusion as to its dramatic value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[380]</span></p>

<p>He was very uncomfortable, though, as he answered:
‘Oh, rot, mother; you know that is impossible. I wish
you would not say such things. You don’t want to make
me out a beast to you, do you, just because I don’t
want to be a beast to Ivor? It’s all rot finding fault
with him, you know. He is a jolly good fellow, and
father would not have got him here if he had not liked
him too. So he must be all right, anyway.’</p>

<p>With a fatal lack of tact, Gundred went off on a
side issue, and began protesting against the unnecessary
crudeness of her son’s language&mdash;a crudeness which
she made haste to attribute to Ivor’s degrading
influence.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ replied Jim, ‘if there is nothing else to say
against poor old Ivor than that! He isn’t the first
person in the world who has said “rot,” and I don’t
imagine he will be the last.’ And on that hit he rose
and made his escape, despite his mother’s attempts to
restrain him with loving arms, and exact, by kisses, a
more satisfactory termination to the dialogue.</p>

<p>Gundred was left alone, feeling solitude as she had
very rarely felt it in her life before. This intruder
had destroyed the harmony of her home, had blighted
her relations with her submissive subjects, had sapped
loyalty, filial piety and honour in the hearts of all who
owed her duty. This influence was altogether evil,
and must be defeated without loss of another day. It
was a blessed work this that Heaven had appointed her
to do, and it must be done briskly, whole-heartedly,
without any lookings-back from the plough, or weaknesses
of any kind. Gundred began to revolve
measures, and plans at last grew definite in her mind.
She faced her course of action boldly. Ivor must be
got rid of&mdash;somehow, anyhow. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui veut la fin, veut
les moyens.</i></p>

<p>And at this point she suddenly grew frightened.<span class="pagenum">[381]</span>
This road that she was treading, into what grim and
stony places would it lead her? Gundred, for the first
time in her life, began to feel afraid of herself. The
intense fire of the righteous passion that consumed her,
well, it was alarming, although it was so righteous.
So righteous? A very faint flicker of hesitation
dawned in Gundred’s mind. <em>Was</em> this passion of hers
so righteous? It was carrying her, she felt, toward
actions that sooner or later might be dark and dreadful;
all the more important, then, to make sure beforehand
that it was an inspiration of Heaven, not, by any
chance, a temptation from Hell. Hitherto Gundred
had never doubted that the Almighty had created her
for a shining instance of the soul which is temptation-proof;
now, however, she began to waver in her belief
that she, alone of mortal beings, was set above the wiles
of evil. After all, she was human; it was just barely
imaginable that this uplifting ardour that she felt
might proceed from the Powers of darkness rather than
from those of light. That anger and hatred are often
laudable she knew well, but this anger and hatred of
hers were so devastating, so tyrannous that she could
not, in all candour, feel herself absolutely certain of
their celestial origin. She felt, as she pondered the
matter, that she was indeed showing proper conscientiousness,
an almost unworthy tenderness towards
that Amalekite of an enemy; but the question was so
important, so much hung on it, that no labour could be
wasted in making sure as to the rights and wrongs of
the case.</p>

<p>After all, though, would the Almighty have allowed
her to entertain such passions if He had not meant her
to indulge them? Yet even the greatest saints had
been tempted by the devil. Indeed, the greater the
saint the greater the temptation. The problem was
nice, and required careful weighing. In any other case<span class="pagenum">[382]</span>
she would readily have conceded that such a passion
might have been inspired without the connivance of
the Almighty; in her own she was so perfectly, though
so humbly, convinced that she lived and spoke as the
mouthpiece of Heaven itself that she could hardly
conceive it possible but that any feeling she nourished
must, of necessity, be just and holy, through the very
fact that it was she, the Lady Gundred Darnley, who
had engendered and developed it. However, a pious
doubt now besieged her, and she dutifully cast about
in her mind for means to solve this riddle that her
scrupulous sense of right had set before her. Until
this was decided, she felt that it would be unfair to
proceed to extremities even against Ivor Restormel.
But how to decide it?</p>

<p>Prayer, Gundred felt, was the only obvious method.
The Almighty must be asked to declare as to the
sanctity of the crusade that she was meditating.
Gundred, filled with the consciousness of holiness,
would, nevertheless, go to Heaven to have that consciousness
confirmed. In all ways she was clean and
blameless, worthy of the celestial attention. She
looked doubtfully for a moment at the little fair curls
that lay on her dressing-table. But after all, they
could not really be called a fraud on the Almighty, for
were they not built up out of her own hoarded combings?
And, for the rest, there was no other spot of
deceit or frailty anywhere in her. So she knelt in
confidence, and prayed. If her hatred for Ivor
Restormel were wicked, would God give a sign by
causing it to die immediately? On the other hand,
if it continued to thrive in her heart, she would take
its persistence as a sign that it was very pleasing in
the sight of Heaven, and might be pursued to its
ultimate extremities. She laboured the point once
more, so that Heaven could not possibly fail to grasp<span class="pagenum">[383]</span>
it. If to-morrow she still hated Ivor Restormel, she
would understand that her hatred was pious and
profitable; if she should awake feeling filled with love
and pity for him, then she must believe that her previous
inspiration had been a temptation of the Evil
One. Filled with a sense of imminent revelation,
Gundred went to bed, and could hardly sleep for
anxiety as to the morrow, and the sentiments that
the morrow would show forth.</p>

<p>It was late when she woke from tardy and troubled
dreams. Over her soul for a minute or two there
brooded a heavy weight of mystery. Something wonderful
was immediately to happen. But for a moment
she could not discern what it was. Then she remembered
her prayer, and fell to scanning her morning’s
feelings for its answer. The revelation was at hand.
But it would only burst upon her fully when she had
come face to face with her imagined enemy. In a
ferment of anxiety she had herself dressed, then hurried
downstairs, her colour perceptibly heightened and her
demeanour almost ruffled by the tense anxiety of her
expectation. Into the morning-room she hastened,
eager to find Ivor Restormel. There he was; she
paused upon the threshold watching him, and waiting
for the miraculous guidance that Heaven would certainly
vouchsafe. Had her feelings for him changed
during the night? In a flash of satisfaction the answer
came, admitting no further question or cavil.</p>

<p>For she hated him as much as ever. Yes, certainly
as much as ever&mdash;even more, perhaps. And nothing
could so clearly prove, after her prayers, that her
hatred was pleasing to the Almighty. If it had been
evil, He would, of course, have annulled it, according
to request. God evidently meant her to hate Ivor
Restormel, and to doubt any more would be nothing
short of wicked infidelity. Triumphant in perfect<span class="pagenum">[384]</span>
satisfaction, in self-complacency restored and enhanced
by this prodigious proof of God’s approval,
Gundred addressed herself quietly to everyday life
once more. Strengthened in her Heaven-sent attitude
of mind, she advanced towards the breakfast-table
with an added majesty of calm, and scattered greetings
with a fair assumption of benevolence. With the
answer to her prayer a sense of rest had come upon her
and made it easier for her to be kind even to Ivor
Restormel. She found the others of her party busy
discussing some new and interesting point. Jim made
haste to enlighten her.</p>

<p>‘The Rovers are going down Long Kern this morning,
mother,’ he exclaimed. ‘And Ivor says he is going
with them. I am awfully keen to go, too. Don’t you
think I might?’</p>

<p>Gundred instantly avenged herself for the suffering
that her son’s perverse disloyalty had been so long
inflicting upon her.</p>

<p>‘Most certainly not,’ she replied. ‘I have a perfect
horror of such places. You would not wish him to go,
Kingston&mdash;no?’</p>

<p>‘There can’t be any danger,’ replied Kingston;
‘they will have efficient ropes and things. And
Weston says there are the most wonderful caves at the
bottom.’</p>

<p>‘Are you really going, Mr. Restormel?’ asked Gundred,
without paying further heed to Jim’s protests
or Jim’s disappointment. She saw in a second
how brilliantly God had answered her prayers for help.
Long Kern was a small but deadly rift in the limestone
of the hill above, which dropped three hundred feet of
narrow shaft sheer down to unfathomable caverns
below. Gundred saw clearly that the whole problem
of her life was to be solved by a miracle. For Heaven
may make a miracle out of any particularly happy<span class="pagenum">[385]</span>
coincidence. And what coincidence could possibly be
more happy, more miraculous than this? For God
clearly meant to destroy Ivor Restormel underground.</p>

<p>Ivor, meanwhile, declared that he was eagerly looking
forward to the exploration. The Rovers, about a
dozen of them, were to make the descent at midday,
and meant to stay in the caves down below until they
had unravelled, as far as possible, the labyrinth of their
passages. As for precautions and methods, they were
to use rope-ladders and guiding wires, so that no real
risk of any sort could be anticipated.</p>

<p>Gundred listened with a wise smile. She knew
better. Ivor Restormel might take as many precautions
as he pleased; nothing could avail him against
the combined weight of Gundred’s prayers and
Heaven’s attention to them. This scheme of his was
quite obviously the direct inspiration of the Powers
above, working in Ivor to his destruction, as they had
worked so many years ago for the fatal hardening of
Pharaoh’s heart in Egypt. Gundred blandly acquiesced,
and lent an unusually pleasant countenance
to the young man’s exposition of his plans. As he was
so evidently doomed, she might fairly relax the
righteousness of her wrath against him. Even for
one merciful moment she thought of interposing, of
saving Ivor’s life by deprecating his scheme. But the
moment passed&mdash;she saw how irreverent it would be
to counter Heaven’s design. And to oppose Ivor’s
plan would necessarily be to oppose Heaven’s also.
So Gundred piously resigned everything into God’s
hands, and stood aside to let matters take their
course.</p>

<p>Jim, meanwhile, was pressing her with pleas that he
also might be allowed to join the party. His father, too,
did not seem disinclined to grant his request. Gundred
returned briskly to the immediate present.<span class="pagenum">[386]</span>
No, no; this complicating element must on no account
be introduced. She could trust Heaven to look after
Ivor Restormel when once he was inside Long Kern,
but she was not at all inclined to trust It to discriminate
between the innocent and the guilty, when it came to
arranging the rock-fall or the sudden rush of water
which she anticipated with a certain holy complacency.
All Ivor’s companions would almost certainly perish
with him. On no account, then, must her own precious
child run any risk of being included in the Evil One’s
condemnation. She looked at Jim, so eager, so young,
so brilliant.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the world her hidden nature
loved so hungrily. By comparison even her great love
for Kingston was very much a matter of pride and habit.
But Jim was her own, of her own body, of her own
blood, the crowning achievement of her life, the visible
evidence of Heaven’s approval. In himself he was
altogether lovely and delightful. And beyond all that
again, beyond his own personal qualities, he stood to
Gundred for the other thing she most venerated and
cherished in the world&mdash;the glory of March and Brakelond.
When he grew up he was to resume his mother’s
name, and unite the resplendency of the Mortimers
with the money of the Darnleys; and then, when her
father died, it was an open secret that the dignities
of the House would be revived in the person of her
son. Gundred felt that through her own wifely and
motherly virtues she had been privileged to support
the banner of March and Brakelond. It was because
she had always been so humble, so devout, that such
an honour had been vouchsafed her, and her son was
doubly precious in her eyes, not only in himself, but
as the Duke of her own providing, who should continue,
from his high place, to set an example of Evangelical
piety to the people of England. She shuddered<span class="pagenum">[387]</span>
at the thought of allowing her jewel to run into danger,
and made haste to make it very certain to Jim that in
no circumstances would he be allowed to share Ivor’s
descent of Long Kern.</p>

<p>‘You don’t want to get wet and cold right down
there in the horrid dark&mdash;no?’ concluded Gundred
ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>‘But it won’t be wet,’ protested the boy. ‘Father
has had the stream dammed about two hundred yards
above the hole. Otherwise they would not have been
able to go down at all. They would all have been
drowned. The water is very high just now, after the
rain. But, as it is, it will be quite dry down in the
caves.’</p>

<p>But Gundred, strong in her private foresight of
Heaven’s intentions, could not be swayed from her
decision. Kingston was forced into the contest, and
found himself compelled, for the sake of peace and
dignity, to endorse his wife’s prohibition. Jim subsided
at last, flushed with resentful disappointment.
Gundred, meantime, was eating her egg dispassionately,
with her usual seraphic tranquillity, while her
heart was filled with strange, conflicting feelings. She
looked across at Ivor Restormel with secret curiosity.
She knew that he was doomed, and in the last moments
could not stifle a certain pity which struck her as being
faintly irreligious and painfully human. But he was
so young and so beautiful, however evil and pernicious.
To die down there in the eternal darkness,
caught like a rat in a trap by the vengeance of Heaven,
that was a pitiable fate. That it would assuredly
descend Gundred could no longer entertain a doubt,
and, when she remembered that it was her own prayers
that had jogged Heaven into this intervention, she felt
a dim pricking of remorse. During the few hours that
remained she would be kind to the predestined victim.<span class="pagenum">[388]</span>
Ivor was pleasantly surprised by the suavity with
which Lady Gundred offered him a second cup of tea.</p>

<p>‘Do have some more,’ pleaded Gundred; ‘you will
want to be properly prepared for this wonderful
expedition of yours. Shall I tell them to make you up
a little lunch?’</p>

<p>In her heart of hearts she knew that he would never
need lunch on earth again, and her economical temper
grieved to think of the hard-boiled eggs and the cress
sandwiches that would be wasted if her offer were
accepted. But, as he could not be expected to know
how profitless Heaven intended to make any packets
of lunch that she might provide, she felt that the kindness
must in common decency be offered.</p>

<p>Ivor, however, replied that he hoped to be back at
Ivescar in plenty of time for tea, and that he would not
trouble about food till then. Gundred smiled and
sighed to think how tragically he was mistaken. Her
feelings were firm and rigid. Long thought and long
anxiety had crystallized now into a mystic ecstasy of
certainty. In the previous weeks she had known
sore vacillations and distresses. But now the friendly
Powers had made everything plain once more. Until
this morning she had felt a certain weakness and need
of earthly counsel; as a sound Evangelical Protestant,
she had, of course, a proper pious horror of the priesthood
and the confessional; and yet there had been
times when she would have liked to pour forth her
troubles to a fellow-creature. Had she consulted a
doctor rather than a priest, he might have told her that
an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">idée fixe</i> is not the healthiest companion for a
woman of self-contained and secret nature, and that
the previous generations of March and Brakelond,
feeble-minded or eccentric, held out a special prospect
of disaster when such an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">idée fixe</i> was cherished by
herself. However, by now, the time for warnings and<span class="pagenum">[389]</span>
advice was past. Gundred was fully possessed by the
mania that had arisen so naturally from her devout
habits and her weak mind, wrought on by jealousy
and by a tyrannous consciousness of being herself the
chosen of Heaven. Now she faced what she foresaw
to be the punishment of her enemy, with the cold calm
of Jael. She was glad that Heaven had taken the
affair so promptly into its own hands.</p>

<p>Once before, her Celestial Ally, she remembered, had
intervened by a miracle to relieve her from the perilous
presence of Isabel Darrell. Now the same prodigy of
favour was to be repeated in a different form, and who
was she to carp at the tender mercies of the Almighty?
With folded hands and placid heart she sat by to let
matters take their appointed way. Nothing in all
the world would so utterly have horrified her as the
statement that she desired the death of Ivor Restormel.
She repeated to herself again and again that she wanted
nothing of the sort, but had perfect trust in the wisdom
of the All-wise. She had no desires of any kind;
nothing but pure faith. And to wish for anyone’s
death, how very abominable and unchristian and unwomanly!
Far, far from her gentle mind was any
such truculent passion; the utmost that she would
own to herself was that she would find it impossible to
grieve when Heaven had taken her enemy to its mercy.
And, as for altering the course of events, that was
clearly out of the question. She could only await
what Heaven should send. She now forgot that she
herself, as it were, had given Heaven a nudge in the
matter. She deliberately disclaimed all responsibility,
and plumed herself on the mildness and resignation
that her conduct showed. Stiff and calm in what
by now was nothing short of monomania, the unfortunate
woman sat and smiled, as her own damnation
passed onwards to its accomplishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[390]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, her husband was making a
suggestion. She came back out of her dream to hear it.</p>

<p>‘Why shouldn’t you and I and Jim go up to Long
Kern and watch them go down?’ he said, anxious to
indemnify Jim as far as possible for the disappointment
which his mother had inflicted. As soon as
Gundred understood the proposition she gasped. This
seemed almost too heavy a trial for her to bear. Then
she suddenly understood that this was the sanctifying
sacrifice that Heaven demanded of her. She must
stand by and watch the fulfilment of her prayers so as
to make the intervention of Heaven complete and
holy. She signified her assent.</p>

<p>‘But we must be back in time for lunch, dear,’ she
conditioned, living her dual life as ever, one-half of her
personality dwelling perpetually in dining-rooms and
drawing-rooms, while the other soared into the high
domains of religious frenzy. Then, breakfast being
over, she rose and went her way mechanically upon her
household duties, pending the awful consummation of
her destiny, at which she was so soon to assist.</p>

<p>At the appointed time she was ready for the start.
The others were waiting for her in the hall, and they
proceeded silently up towards the hills. Jim was too
excited to talk much; a scheme that demanded all his
attention was budding in his brain; Gundred, by now,
was moving in a remote world far above earthly speech,
in communion with the invisible. Ivor himself vaguely
discerned some strange exaltation beneath the restraint
of Gundred’s mood, and was reluctant to intrude his
conversation. And Kingston himself was so sick and
tired of his long struggle to achieve the impossible
recognition that he had not the heart nor the temper
to say much to the perverse human individuality that
intervened so bitterly between him and the eternal
memory it contained. So they surmounted the long<span class="pagenum">[391]</span>
ridges of limestone, and came out at last upon the
stretches of moor above that undulated gently upward
towards the steep skirt of the Simonstone. The air
that morning was clean and pure, filled with a white
light and a bracing virility of tone; much rain
had fallen in the last two days, and the atmosphere
was moist and brilliant in colouring; great snowy
ranges of cloud went sailing gloriously across the wet
azure of Heaven, and the great mountain above
towered high overhead in soft masses of brown and
purplish green, while before them the moorland rolled
away in waves of rust-coloured velvet, to where it
suddenly ceased, in a sharp line that seemed the rim
of the world, beneath which, far below, lay the broad
valley and the plain-lands. The surface of the fell
had folds and dimples and crests, but in the huge
monotony of the expanse it appeared a waved sea of
colour. Down the little gullies ran here and there a
stream, riotous after the rains of over-night; here and
there in the levels lay a small peat-pool that glittered
like a forgotten silver shield among the sedges. And
then they came at last to a deeper, steeper cañon, which
soon broke off in a blind hollow, ringed in by precipitous
banks of heather. And here it was that the stream
which filled the channel disappeared. Long Kern was
impressive in its very unimpressiveness. It was but a
short and narrow slit between two masses of flat
white limestone, and across the orifice a fallen boulder
made a bridge. Hardly two yards intervened between
the one lip and the other. And in that space yawned
a solid shaft of black night. Sheer down and down
fell the water that filled the chasm, three hundred feet
and more, to the rayless labyrinth of caverns that made
the heart of the mountain. Coming suddenly across
this rift in the moorland one would at first have thought
it nothing, a drop, perhaps of a fathom or so. It<span class="pagenum">[392]</span>
was terribly inconspicuous and prosaic. Then, stepping
along the rocky bridge that crossed it, one might be
struck with a suggestion of its possibilities, and,
throwing a rock into the darkness, might hear, after a
long pause, the crashing rumble of its impact far below,
as it bounded and dashed from ledge to ledge and side
to side of the gulf, till it sent faintly up to the listener’s
ear its last remote thunderous echoes from the black
lake three hundred feet below, where the dim roar
reverberated along the walls and ramifications of the
cavern.</p>

<p>On the brink the party paused. Ordinarily the
place was lonely and desolate, but to-day there were
signs of occupation and activities. Beams were
stretched across the narrow gulf, and coils of rope were
lying ready. The Rovers were scattered about,
making their preparations for the descent. They were
a club of professional men from the neighbouring large
manufacturing towns, who amused themselves by
exploring the recesses of the caves that honeycombed
the Simonstone. On many previous occasions Kingston
had made their efforts easier. And to-day, for the
exploration of Long Kern, he had given them indispensable
help by having the rain-swollen stream
dammed off. The bed of the river was now nearly
dry, and the water diverted into another channel.
Otherwise, as Jim had said, the descent would have
been impossible. The Rovers were very grateful,
accordingly, for this spirited collaboration, and gave
the Darnleys a warm welcome. To all four they extended
an offer to make the descent, and when it
appeared that Ivor Restormel was the only one who
would accept their invitation, they showed a little
disappointment. With Jim especially they pled to
accompany them, tantalizing him cruelly, and were
only made to desist at last by the unequivocal firmness<span class="pagenum">[393]</span>
of Lady Gundred’s hostility towards the proposal.
And so they set about the last preparations. Gaily
talking and laughing among themselves, they proceeded
to the fastening of ropes and the final arrangements
for the descent.</p>

<p>Suddenly Gundred could bear the ordeal no longer.
The matter-of-fact, innocent cheerfulness of it all was
too much for her, with her terrible secret foreknowledge.
She knew that Heaven had doomed every one
of those happy people, so as to make sure of Ivor
Restormel. Of course, he alone might fall, or strangle,
or have a stone dropped on his head. But, on the
whole, it was far more likely, far more in accordance
with Scriptural precedent, that guilty and innocent
should all perish together. So much the worse for the
innocent! Her mystic exaltation did not go the length
of protesting against their fatal plan at the eleventh
hour, but it was not quite firm and faithful enough to
bear the grim spectacle unmoved. She turned hastily
and moved away up the empty bed of the stream,
leaving Jim and her husband to watch the descent.
From the bend in the river-bed she turned to take a
last look at her enemy. He was still chattering and
smiling with his friends, adapting the rope, adjusting
satchels and packages. Kingston was saying something
at which they both laughed. Then Gundred,
very sick and heavy at heart, in spite of her sense of
sacred ecstasy, turned the corner and was out of sight
of the pothole.</p>

<p>Kingston eyed the narrow gulf of darkness with unspoken
dread. Now, at the last moment, he disliked
Ivor’s determination to share the descent. He hated
the idea of watching the boy disappear into that night
below. It seemed too symbolic of that eternal night
into which the restored memory must one day pass
again. And yet, the granting of his own importunate<span class="pagenum">[394]</span>
desire, what had it brought him except the bitterness
of a yet fiercer, more insatiable desire? For a while
he would even be glad to have rest from his tormenting,
baffling intimacy with the secret thing that could
never hear the cry of his voice. Let the boy go down,
then, into the darkness, carrying with him that wonderful
mystical thing that he enshrined. Kingston’s
fingers were raw and bleeding, his whole soul broken
and agonized with long fruitless plucking and battering
at the locked doors of that shrine. Let it go, then, for
half an hour, and leave him at peace. As it had returned
to him once before, out of the greater darkness
of the grave, so, in the course of a few moments, it
would come back to light again from the darkness of
the pit, and all his torments would be renewed, growing
ever keener and fiercer towards the dim end that he
dared not try to foresee. The knowledge of doom
was black and heavy upon him as he watched the boy
preparing for his disappearance, and, in the concentration
of his bitter mood, he hardly heard the voice of
Jim, now once more raised in eager pleading to be
allowed the joy of the descent.</p>

<p>Gundred meanwhile was wandering on in a stupor,
not thinking, not daring to think. The whole of life
seemed to her to be hanging in suspense. The next
half-hour was to vindicate her righteousness and make
dreadfully manifest the majesty of Heaven. Her
brain oscillated in coma, and she was no longer conscious
of any pain or any feeling at all. Everything
passed from her mind except the actual physical
pleasure of the moment, the keen freshness of the air,
the lovely colours of life, the myriad little voices that
haunted the world. Then suddenly they were all
merged in one vehement, rushing murmur. She
looked down. She had arrived at the dam that
diverted the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[395]</span></p>

<p>A bank of turf and stones had been built, and against
its barrier the brown water surged and ravened
angrily, in a froth of white bubbles and spume, eager
to take its old way down into the pothole and the
caverns below. Disappointed, however, of its hope,
it must needs go foaming and scolding along an unaccustomed
course, over green grasses, drenched and
streaming in its current, and down a slope of rush and
sedge. Soothed unconsciously by its hum, Gundred
sat down and idly watched the raging swirl of the
water. It was well that the stream had been thus
firmly held back and diverted, for a huge mass of water
it was that made it so turbulent. After two days’
rain on the Simonstone, all the waters of the mountain
were in flood, and the Long Kern should naturally
have been filled with a roaring spate. Suddenly
Gundred’s human consciousness was vaguely aware of
an alteration. Something seemed to be shifting, the
noise of the fretted torrent changing its note. Then
she saw a filament of water percolating. As she
watched, it widened. The dam was not strong enough
to bear the surging wrath behind it. The dam was
breaking; Gundred awoke with a violent start. She
rose and turned impulsively towards the pothole&mdash;on
the point of running, of shrieking a warning, of doing
something helpful or human. Then, in an instant, she
understood that she could do nothing&mdash;understood
what it was that Heaven had achieved for her. Her
prayer had been answered. She must give thanks,
and stand aside.</p>

<p>Firmly, decidedly, with head carried high, and the
fanatic’s mad light in her eyes, Gundred turned away
from the stream and walked swiftly home across the
moor. What came after was the work of Heaven.
Heaven must take full responsibility. Heaven had
broken the dam; Heaven might easily have ordained<span class="pagenum">[396]</span>
that the descent should not yet have commenced.
Gundred had done nothing. Heaven had done it all.
She could only go quietly home and trust in the wise
mercies of Providence. In an hour or so she would
hear what had happened.</p>

<p>But, though she did not know it, the strain on her
endurance was fearfully heavy. She found her mind
perpetually wandering back to the Long Kern, wondering
in an agony whether the explorers had already
embarked on their adventure when that roaring volume
of brown water had swept thunderously down upon
them&mdash;wondering whereabouts in that perilous chasm
it had caught them, what it must feel like to be so
suddenly, so fearfully battered out of life, and swept
away into the abysses of the Underworld. Her brain
was a sickening chaos. Fire and water, fire and water;
the two great moments of her life had come to her
through fire and water. Through the roaring waters
of that broken dam she vaguely remembered the
roaring fires of Brakelond. Isabel&mdash;Isabel&mdash;in a way,
had given her life for Gundred; and Gundred?&mdash;Gundred,
after many years, had, in a way, stood by
and watched the taking of other lives. Dimly, instinctively,
she could not refrain from comparing the
two catastrophes, from feeling a blind, illogical sense
that they stood in some mystic relation to each other.
And so, alone, she came at last to Ivescar.</p>

<p>Her training stood her in good stead, and enabled her
to go subconsciously through the routine duties of her
day. She did not put off lunch when her husband
failed to return, but ate it in solitary state, and heartily&mdash;recognising
that it was always her duty to sustain her
body. Her soul, however, was very far away. In her
inmost heart she knew that Ivor Restormel was dead.
She did not dare to face the knowledge and understand
it, but it was there, gnawing, persistent. She<span class="pagenum">[397]</span>
steeled herself to bear the terrible news that Jim and
Kingston must soon be bringing back. And lunch
must be kept hot for them. As the hours went by and
brought no certainty to end her growing suspense, the
pandemonium of clamouring voices in Gundred’s
brain grew louder, more confused, more frightening.
She seemed on the very edge of something very horrible&mdash;she,
the favourite, the chosen, the glorified of
Heaven. Something very horrible was surging into
sight. In another moment she would see it. Terror&mdash;mysterious,
ghastly&mdash;seized and gripped her. Then
in the silence she heard approaching footsteps. The
Horror was at hand. Gundred rose, pale and trembling,
exerting all her forces, even in this last moment, to
preserve the outward decorum of her demeanour. The
door opened, and her husband came into the room.
She stared at him in dumb dread. For a moment he
could command no words. In silence his eyes met hers.
His voice was low and husky and shattered, when at
last he had gathered strength to speak.</p>

<p>‘Gundred,’ he whispered&mdash;‘Gundred....’</p>

<p>She interrupted him. Now, in the fulfilment of her
destiny, a dreadful courage flowed back to her.</p>

<p>‘Something terrible has happened,’ she said; ‘tell
me quickly.’</p>

<p>He was too busy with his own grief to notice that she
seemed prepared for what she was about to hear.</p>

<p>‘The dam,’ he answered&mdash;‘the dam. It broke. It
burst as soon as they had gone down.’</p>

<p>Gundred clasped her hands tightly to prevent their
trembling from being observed. She spoke as if in a
dream.</p>

<p>‘And Ivor,’ she asked, unconsciously using the
Christian name&mdash;‘Ivor, is he safe?’</p>

<p>Kingston laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>‘Safe?’ he cried&mdash;‘safe? Ivor is dead. They are<span class="pagenum">[398]</span>
all dead. I waited till they had got the bodies up.
The flood soon subsided, and the men were able to get
down and find the bodies. That is why I waited.’</p>

<p>Gundred moaned. The reality was more crushing
than she had ever feared. God had granted her
desire, but in a terrific way, and its granting brought
her small joy. She almost ceased to feel holy.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Kingston,’ she murmured.... ‘Kingston,
how awful! Too shocking to think of&mdash;too shocking
to think of.’ She shook her head, covering her eyes
as if to shut out the vision of those wretched adventurers
caught and swept away by the flood which her
prayers had loosed upon them. In that moment she
felt a murderess. And the sanctity of the murder
faded from her mind. Then she turned to the one spot
of comfort in the whole disaster. What a merciful
interposition of Heaven it was that had prevented her
from allowing Jim to make the descent. That preservation
in itself showed the special favour of the Almighty.
He had set her son apart from the catastrophe
that He had ordained. Her voice was calmer
as she uncovered her face and spoke again.</p>

<p>‘And Jim?’ she asked. ‘What have you done with
him? I do pray he did not see this dreadful sight.
Poor little Jim! What an awful shock it would have
been!’ Then she caught her husband’s eye, and
paused in sudden terror of what she saw there....
‘Kingston?’ she cried. He could give no answer.
‘Kingston?’ she repeated sharply, her voice rising to
a shrill note of anxiety. ‘Kingston, what is it?’</p>

<p>‘Jim went down with the others,’ said her husband
in a low, colourless tone. ‘He wanted so much to go.
I said he might. Jim went down with the others.’</p>

<p>Gundred gave a short cry.</p>

<p>‘Then how did you succeed in saving him?’ she
gasped. ‘How was it he was not drowned with the<span class="pagenum">[399]</span>
others? Kingston, how did you succeed in saving
him?’</p>

<p>‘I did not,’ answered Kingston very quietly. ‘Jim
is drowned. They are bringing back his body now with
the others.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Gundred, in a fearful stupefaction of
calm&mdash;‘no, it is not possible. Jim is not dead. God
must have saved him. It is not possible.’ Then her
quiet cracked like glass. ‘Kingston,’ she screamed,
‘say it is not possible. Jim is safe.’</p>

<p>The father shook his head. ‘Jim is drowned,’ he
repeated. ‘Drowned with the others.’</p>

<p>A deadly silence fell between them. Gundred
pressed both hands to her head. The brain inside was
a fiery wheel of agony, blinding her with the coruscations
of its anguish. Then at last her hands sank to
her sides and she looked up. Her face was fixed and
ghastly, her voice unnaturally stolid as she spoke.</p>

<p>‘There!’ said Gundred very slowly and deliberately.
‘That is what comes of disobeying one’s mother!’
Then she broke abruptly into peal on peal of high
laughter. Shrieking with horrible merriment, she fell
back upon the sofa, rocking to and fro in the convulsion
of her madness. Kingston dropped into a
chair, and hid his head in his hands. It seemed as
if that fearful noise would never cease. And yet he
could see nothing, hear nothing. He was alone for
ever in the black darkness. Everything was gone.
And still Gundred sat and laughed.</p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Major-General</span> SIR OWEN TUDOR BURNE,
G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Demy 8vo. With Illustrations.</em> <b>15s. net.</b></p>

<p>Sir Owen Burne joined the 20th Regiment (now the Lancashire
Fusiliers) in 1855. He came in for the end of the Crimean War and
served throughout the Indian Mutiny, receiving two steps in rank
for gallantry in the field. Not long afterwards he became Military
Secretary to the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Hugh Rose. He was
Private Secretary to Lord Mayo until his assassination, and made
a personal report on that tragic event to the Queen. Later he
became Secretary in the Political and Secret Department of the
India Office. He was also Private Secretary to Lord Lytton,
when Viceroy, and served ten years as a member of the Council
of India.</p>

<p>An interesting chapter of Sir Owen’s reminiscences deals with the
year 1873, when, as Political A.D.C. to the Secretary of State for
India, he assisted Sir Henry Rawlinson in taking charge of the
Shah of Persia during his visit to England. Copious extracts are
given from His Majesty’s diary, which has come into Sir Owen’s
hands.</p>

<p>The book is a lively record of a distinguished career, freely interspersed
with amusing stories, and illustrated with photographs of
some noteworthy groups.</p>

<p class="center xlargefont">SOME PROBLEMS OF EXISTENCE.</p>

<p class="center">By NORMAN PEARSON.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Demy 8vo.</em> <b>7s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>Dealing with such Problems of Existence as the origin of life,
spirit and matter, free will, determinism and morality, and the sense
of sin, Mr. Pearson lays down as postulates for a theory which
philosophy and religion may be able to accept, and which science
need not reject&mdash;(1) the existence of a Deity; (2) the immortality of
man; and (3) a Divine scheme of evolution of which we form part,
and which, as expressing the purpose of the Deity, proceeds under
the sway of an inflexible order. The author’s method is well calculated
to appeal to the general reader, though some of his conclusions
as to the past and future of humanity differ considerably from
popularly received opinions on the subject.</p>

<p class="center xlargefont">SIX RADICAL THINKERS.</p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">JOHN MacCUNN</span>, LL.D.,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor of Philosophy in the University of Liverpool</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Crown 8vo.</em> <b>6s. net.</b></p>

<p>These brilliant essays possess an exceptional interest at the
present moment when Liberal and Radical principles bulk so largely
in the political arena. The six main subjects of Professor MacCunn’s
volume are Bentham and his Philosophy of Reform, the Utilitarian
Optimism of John Stuart Mill, the Commercial Radicalism of
Cobden, the Anti-Democratic Radicalism of Thomas Carlyle, the
Religious Radicalism of Joseph Mazzini, and the Political Idealism
of T. H. Green.</p>

<p class="center xlargefont">A PICNIC PARTY IN WILDEST
AFRICA.</p>

<p class="center">By C. W. L. BULPETT.</p>

<p class="center boldfont">Being a Sketch of a Winter’s Trip to some of the Unknown Waters
of the Upper Nile.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Demy 8vo. With Illustrations and Map.</em> <b>12s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>The object of the expedition described in this book was to survey
the Musha and Boma plateaux, which lie between the River Akobo
and Lake Rudolf. It was organized by Mr. W. N. McMillan, an
experienced American traveller, and was remarkably successful,
though the fact that one of the caravans marched thirty-eight days
on half-rations, largely through a country flooded by incessant rain,
shows that the excursion was very far from being altogether a picnic.
Mounts Ungwala and Naita were ascended, and hundreds of square
miles of previously unexplored country were surveyed and mapped.
The accounts of the abundance of game will make the sportsman’s
mouth water.</p>

<p>A considerable amount of the description of scenery and life on the
Nile and Sobat is extracted from the journal of Mrs. McMillan, who
accompanied her husband. Many of the illustrations are from
drawings made on the spot by Mr. Jessen, cartographer of the
expedition.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Demy 8vo. With Portrait.</em> <b>10s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>In the course of a prolonged residence at Zanzibar as consular
representative of Germany, Dr. Brode became intimately acquainted
with the celebrated adventurer Tippoo Tib, and succeeded in
inducing him to write the story of his life. This he did, in Swaheli,
using Arabic characters, which Dr. Brode transcribed for translation
into German. The material thus supplied by Tippoo Tib has been
expanded by Dr. Brode into a remarkable picture of Africa before
and during its transition into the hands of the white man.</p>

<p class="center boldfont">A Study of Greece in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class="center"><em>2 Volumes. Demy 8vo. With Illustrations and Map.</em> <b>25s. net.</b></p>

<p>In this masterly work Sir Rennell Rodd deals with a curiously
interesting and fascinating subject which has never been treated of
in English, though a few scanty notices of the period may be found.
It is gratifying to know that the British School in Athens has of
late turned its attention to the Byzantine and Frankish remains in
the Morea. Meanwhile this book will fill a great blank in the
historical knowledge of most people.</p>

<p class="center">By F. M. CORNFORD, M.A.,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fellow and Lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Demy 8vo.</em> <b>10s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>This is an important contribution to the study of Thucydides.
Having attributed the causes of the Peloponnesian War almost entirely
to commercial factors, Mr. Cornford shows how Thucydides,
free from modern ideas of causation, unfolds the tragedy of Athens,
led by Fortune at Pylos, by the Hybris and Infatuation of Cleon and
Alcibiades, to the Nemesis of Syracuse. The book will be found
interesting by all students of history. All passages from Greek
authors are quoted in English in the text, which can be understood
without reference to the Greek in the footnotes.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Crown 8vo.</em> <b>6s.</b></p>

<p>Like its predecessor, this book is not only a mine of interesting
and amusing sketches of life among the poor, but, in its more serious
aspect, a remarkable and most valuable corrective of many widely
prevalent and erroneous views about the habits of thought and ethics
of the poorer classes.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Foolscap 8vo.</em> <b>3s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>This, the third of Colonel Meysey-Thompson’s invaluable handbooks,
will appeal to hunting men as strongly as the previous

absolutely practical, the result of forty years’ experience, and is
largely conveyed in the form of Question and Answer. The arrangement
is especially calculated to facilitate easy reference.</p>

<p>There are very few persons living whose knowledge of English
Society is, literally, so extensive and peculiar as Lady Dorothy
Nevill’s, and fewer still whose recollections of a period extending
from the day of the postchaise to that of the motor-car are as graphic
and entertaining as hers. In the course of her life she has met
almost every distinguished representative of literature, politics and
art, and about many of them she has anecdotes to tell which have
never before been made public. She has much to say of her intimate
friends of an earlier day&mdash;Disraeli, the second Duke of Wellington,
Bernal Osborne, Lord Ellenborough, and a dozen others&mdash;while a
multitude of more modern personages pass in procession across her
light-hearted pages. A reproduction of a recent crayon portrait by

<p class="center xlargefont">PERSONAL ADVENTURES AND
ANECDOTES OF AN OLD OFFICER.</p>

<p class="center">By Colonel JAMES P. ROBERTSON, C.B.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Demy 8vo. With Portraits.</em> <b>12s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>The phrase ‘a charmed life’ is hackneyed, but it may be used
with peculiar appropriateness to describe Colonel Robertson’s
military career. ‘The history of my nose alone,’ says the cheery
old soldier in his Preface, ‘would fill a chapter,’ and, indeed, not
only his nose, but his whole body, seem to have spent their time in,
at all events, running a risk of being seriously damaged in every
possible way. The book, in fact, is simply full of fine confused
fighting and hair-breadth escapes.</p>

<p>Joining the 31st Regiment in 1842, Colonel Robertson took part
in the Sutlej Campaign from Moodkee to Sobraon. He was in the
Crimea, and throughout the Mutiny he commanded a regiment of
Light Cavalry, doing repeatedly the most gallant service. The
incidents of life in Ireland and the Ionian Islands during the intervals
of peace are worthy of ‘Charles O’Malley,’ and are described
with something of Lever’s raciness of touch.</p>

<p>The change of Government, with the consequent variety of political
topics, very greatly enhances the attraction of this new volume of
cartoons by ‘Sir F. C. G.’ If the increased acerbity of political
relations is found to be slightly reflected in these later cartoons, the
many fresh and interesting studies are no less happily handled than
those produced under the Conservative régime.</p>

<p>The object of this American Mission to the Emperor Menelik
was to negotiate a commercial treaty. The Mission was extremely
well received, and the expedition appears to have been a complete
success. The picture drawn by Mr. Skinner of the Abyssinians and
their ruler is an exceedingly agreeable one; and his notes on this
land of grave faces, elaborate courtesy, classic tone, and Biblical
civilization, its history, politics, language, literature, religion, and
trade, are full of interest; there are also some valuable hints on the
organization and equipment of a caravan.</p>

<p>During the last few years Tibet, wrapped through the centuries
in mystery, has been effectively ‘opened up’ to the gaze of the
Western world, and already the reader has at his disposal an
enormous mass of information on the country and its inhabitants.
But there is in Western Tibet a region which is still comparatively
little known, which is especially sacred to the Hindu and Buddhist,
and in which curious myths and still more curious manners abound;
and it is of this portion of the British Borderland, its government, and
the religion and customs of its peoples, that Mr. Sherring writes.</p>

<p>The book contains a thrilling account by Dr. T. G. Longstaff,
M.B., F.R.G.S., of an attempt to climb Gurla Mandhata, the highest
mountain in Western Tibet, with two Swiss guides.</p>

<p class="center">Arranged by his Daughter, LUCY CRUMP.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Demy 8vo. With Portraits.</em> <b>12s. 6d. net.</b></p>

<p>Dr. Birkbeck Hill’s ‘Letters’ form, with a few connecting links
written by his daughter, an autobiography whose charm lies in its
intimate portrayal of a character which was, in its curious intensity,
at once learned, tender, and humorous. He wrote as he talked, and
his talk was famous for its fund of anecdote, of humour, of deep
poetic feeling, of vigorous literary criticism, and no less vigorous
political sentiment. As an Oxford undergraduate, he was one of the
founders, together with Mr. Swinburne, Prof. A. V. Dicey, and
Mr. James Bryce, of the Old Mortality Club. He was intimately
connected also with the Pre-Raphaelites. At college, at home, on
the Continent, or in America, everywhere he writes with the pen of
one who observes everything, and who could fit all he saw that was
new into his vast knowledge of the past. His editions of ‘Boswell’s
Johnson,’ of ‘Johnson’s Letters,’ and ‘The Lives of the Poets’
have passed into classical works. But that his writings were not
exclusively Johnsonian is abundantly shown by such books as the
Letters of Hume, Swift, General Gordon, and Rossetti, as well as
by his ‘Life of Sir Rowland Hill,’ his ‘History of Harvard
University,’ and various collections of essays.</p>

<p>This book is designed especially to meet the needs of those who
have to treat the commoner skin diseases. While giving short
descriptions of the rarer forms, the chief attention is bestowed on
those more frequently met with. The diagnostic features of the
various eruptions are dealt with in detail, in order that they may
give help in determining the lines of treatment. The more recent
work in clinical pathology, both microscopical and chemical, is for
the first time brought into use in an English text-book. The book
is freely illustrated with original photographs.</p>

<p>This book opens with a description of the method of obtaining
gastric contents, and the estimation of the capacity of the stomach.
The various Test Meals employed in diagnosis are next described.
The macroscopical examination of the gastric contents and conclusions
to be drawn on inspection are discussed, and a short description
of the microscopical appearances follows. The chemical
analysis of the gastric contents is then given. The Organic Diseases
of the Stomach are all separately described, with specimen cases of
analysis to illustrate them. The Functional Diseases of the Stomach,
which are more frequently met with in ordinary practice than the
Organic Diseases, are also very fully given. The chemical methods
employed in the investigation of Intestinal Diseases are then described
with great fulness, four types of Test Meals being given.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
